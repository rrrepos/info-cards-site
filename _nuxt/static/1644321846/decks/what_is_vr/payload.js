Virtual tours of places of interest\n2. Train soldiers with the use of simulations\n3. Educational training from home\n4. Architectural walkthru's of places\n5. Virtual Shopping  \n",showQ:a},{q:"What is required to experience VR",a:"1. A VR Headset that provides the immersive experience\n2. The headset or mobile connected to the internet\n3. Access to the virtual environment that is prepared by someone\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is a VR Headset",a:"It is a head-worn apparatus that covers one eyes for an **immersive experience**. It is also called *VR Googles*.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does a VR headset require a mobile",a:"The simpler VR headsets require a mobile to utilise the capabilities of the mobile for connectivity, mic, speaker and sensors. However, standalone VR headsets are available which have all these capabilties in-built.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which sensors are required for a VR experience",a:"Either from within the headset or via the smartphone, VRs use some combination of accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer and proximity sensor to detect the user's motion in the virtual world.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is an Accelerometer",a:"It is a tool that measures acceleration of the body as the user moves across the virtual world",showQ:a},{q:"What is a Gyroscope",a:"It is a tool to sense angular rotational velocity and acceleration of the body as the user turns",showQ:a},{q:"What is a Magnetometer",a:"It is a tool to detect the relative orientation of your mobile \u002F VR relative to the Earth's magnetic north",showQ:a},{q:"Do we see other folks in the virtual world",a:"Yes. But as **avatars**.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are avatars",a:"In VR terms, an avatar is a 3D graphical representation of a user or the user's character or persona",showQ:a},{q:"Can we turn using VR",a:"Yes. It provides a 360 degree view of the virtual world. So turning and moving your head will change the view in all directions.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can we move in the virtual world using VR headset",a:"Yes. When viewing through the headset there is a cursor (much like the cursor of our computer). Often, placing the cursor ahead and tapping a button on the side of the headset transports you there.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can we speak to others in the virtual world",a:"It depends on how the virtual environment has been prepared; if they enable talking to others in the virtual room, then the mic and speaker (of the VR or mobile) will be used for communication",showQ:a},{q:"Who prepares a virtual world",a:"1. The Virtual world is prepared via a software running on some servers.\n2. The Virtual elements like roads, building, walls, seats etc are need to be created using computer graphics.\n3. When we connect to that world (like visiting a website) one can move around the explore the world.\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_vr",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_vr\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-02-04T07:10:10.988Z",updatedAt:"2022-02-04T08:30:09.982Z"},related:[{dir:d,id:b},{dir:d,id:c}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}(true,"what_is_ar","what_is_blockchain_ledger","\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F")));
