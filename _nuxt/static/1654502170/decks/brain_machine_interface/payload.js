But it wasn't till the 90s that some **neuroprosthetic** devices were implanted in humans.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Will a BMI technology help a patient having paralysis",a:"Yes. One of its intent is to let such patients **regain independence** through the control of computers and mobiles e.g. *people with quadriplegia*.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why is it gaining prominence today",a:"Due to advances being made in **Speech synthesis** and **Artificial Intelligence**, one can provide a much *richer* and more *normal* life experience to such people\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the different senses that could potentially be *used* using BMI",a:"The following areas of the brain could get *reactivated* using BMI:\n1. **Visual Cortex**: that processes information from our eyes\n2. **Auditory Cortex**: that process our perception and interpretation of sound\n3. **Somatosensory Cortex**: that process our sense of touch\n4. **Motor Cortex**: that executes our motor movements\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can BMI be used to control, *say a mouse*, on a computer",a:"Yes. As users think of moving their arms, that thought can be **decoded** and sent to the computer to move a *virtual mouse*.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is not electroencephalogram (**EEG**) a BMI",a:"One can think of an **EEG** as a non-invasive BMI\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is **Electrocorticography** (ECoG)",a:"In ECoG the electrodes, used to measure electrical activity of the brain, are **embedded** in a thin plastic pouch and placed *above the cortex* in the brain.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E ECoG is a type of BMI\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the difference between EEG and ECoG",a:"EEG is a **non-invasive** procedure while an ECoG is an **invasive** procedure\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are **Neural Implants**",a:"They are **technological devices** that connect directly to a person's **brain**\n",showQ:a},{q:"Where are they placed",a:"They are usually placed on the **surface** of the brain, or attached to the brain's **cortex**\n",showQ:a},{q:"What purpose do neural implants serve",a:"They electrically **process**, **stimulate** and **transmit** signals from single neurons or groups of neurons in the brain.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Neurons are **cells** of the brain that are informational messengers\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the components of a neural implant",a:"1. It has small flexible *threads* to detect neural signals\n2. It has a **battery** and charger that can be *wirelessly charged from the outside*\n",showQ:a},{q:"How are these implants placed in the brain",a:"They are surgically placed using sophisticated **robotic system** that a neurosurgeon operates \n",showQ:a},{q:"What are some of the challenges in development of the electrodes of these implants",a:"The electrodes must be as **small** and **flexible** as the surrounding neurons. Additionally, its material must be such that it is compatible with the surrounding tissues\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are some of the challenges with the electronics of the implant",a:"The chip in the implant needs to convert the electric signals from the electrodes into neural information and amplify them to external devices. This needs to happen in real-time and must be possible using low-powered devices. This is a huge technological challenge.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are neural implants available today",a:"Experiments have been conducted and some implants have been made. However, it is not yet approved for wide use anywhere.\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fbrain_machine_interface",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fbrain_machine_interface\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-04-23T02:50:56.900Z",updatedAt:"2022-04-25T12:32:24.303Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","gene_editing","digital_twin","medical_nanorobots")));
