Loud snoring\n2. Episodes in which one stops breathing during sleep\n3. Gasping for air during sleep\n4. Awakening with a dry mouth\n5. Morning headache\n6. Difficulty staying asleep\n7. Dozing off while working\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are there types of Sleep Apnea",a:"Yes, there are 3 types:\n1.  **Obstructive sleep apnea**, that occurs when throat muscles relax\n2. **Central sleep apnea**, which occurs when your brain doesn't send proper signals to the muscles that control breathing\n3. **Complex sleep apnea syndrome**, which occurs when someone has both obstructive sleep apnea and central sleep apnea\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which is the most common type of sleep apnea",a:"The **Obstructive** Sleep Apnea",showQ:a},{q:"What happens in the Obstructive sleep apnea",a:"When the muscles in the back of your throat relax, your airway narrows or closes as you breathe in. You can't get enough air, thereby lowering the oxygen level in your blood. Your brain senses your inability to breathe and briefly rouses you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does this cause one to choke or gasp for breath",a:"Yes. This is often reported by the sleeping partner since the patient does not recall it.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How often does this narrowing of airways take place during the sleep",a:"Studies have indicated that it can be anytime from 5 to 30 times\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the causes of Sleep Apnea",a:"1. **Excess Weight**: obesity greatly increases the risk\n2. **Neck circumference**: those with thinner neck have narrower airways\n3. **Narrowed airway**: either due to inheritance or due to tonsils etc\n4. **Being Male**: men are 2-3 times more prone\n5. **Smokers**: have 3 times more probability to develop this condition\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does one diagnose this condition",a:"Ususally begins with the sleep partner detecting the symptoms which will follow a checkup with a doctor\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are there any tests that can be done to confirm the condition",a:"Yes, there are sleep disorder centers where an evaluation is done overnight to detect one's sleep patterns and other body functions during sleep. This could confirm whether a person has sleep apnea or not.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E In recent times these tests can be administered at home too\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is there any cure for Sleep Apnea",a:"If the condition is not severe, most patients uses a **CPAP** machine, tho this is not a cure\n&nbsp;\n\u003E CPAP: Continous Positive Airway Pressure\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does the CPAP machine work",a:"1. A CPAP machine generates a continuous stream of pressurized air that travels through a mask that’s sealed around your nose or mouth delivering purified air.\n2. As you sleep, the airstream now pushes against any blockages, opening your airways so your lungs receive plenty of oxygen.\n3. Without anything obstructing this flow of oxygen, your breathing doesn’t pause giving you a restful night.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is there a similar machine called BiPAP",a:"Yes, it refers to **Bilevel or two-level Positive Airway Pressure**. While CPAP generally delivers a *single pressure*, BiPAP delivers two: an **inhale** pressure and an **exhale** pressure.\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_sleep_apnea",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_sleep_apnea\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-03-11T11:23:25.354Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-24T13:24:07.027Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","nsdr_yoga_nidra","medical_nanorobots","what_are_life_skills")));
