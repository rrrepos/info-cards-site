Creating and sharing videos of famous people when in actual they have not recorded it.\n2. Superimposing someones photos on another photo without easily detecting it\n3. Creating photos of a person who does not exist!\n4. Creating audio in a voice of a famous person giving an impression that it is an original recording\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is a Deepfake video made",a:"1. Usually, one targets a video to use as a basis of the deepfake.\n2. Next, one requires many videos of the person one wants to insert in the video.\n3. The collection of videos are fed to a Deep Learning program that builds a computer model.\n4. The last step is when the targeted video is fed to the model which will replace the original person's face with the target's face, matching the mouth and eye movements\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is an Autoencoder in a deepfake program",a:"The **Autoencoder** is a deep learning AI program tasked with studying the video clips to understand what the person looks like from a variety of angles, and then mapping that person onto the individual in the target video by finding common features\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the use of GANs in a deepfake program",a:"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), detects and improves any flaws in the deepfake within multiple rounds, making it more real-like\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can deepfakes be detected",a:"Yes. Programs are available that can detect if a video or audio is a deepfake or not. Like any other battle, the deepfake programs try to stay one step ahead of the fake detectors\n",showQ:a},{q:"When did deepfakes start",a:"The technologies leading to it began more than a decade back, but with advances in Machine Learning, somewhere in 2017 many pornographic videos of celebrities began showing up that indicated its effectiveness\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are deepfakes illegal",a:"More and more countries are passing laws that treat deepfakes as being fraudulent and illegal to post in social media and elsewhere unless it is explicitly mentioned.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is Synthetic Media",a:"Deepfake is another name for Synthetic Media\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Synthetic media is often the term used when the technology is used for *good purposes*!\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are some of the good use-cases to use synthetic media",a:"1. Educator can now deliver innovative lessons that are far more engaging than traditional visuals \n2. It can bring historical figures back to life for a more engaging and interactive classroom\n3. Famous paintings like the *Mona Lisa* can be made accessible to more folks\n4. Audio story telling can be generated at a fraction of the production costs\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is there an example of famous personality using deepfake",a:"Yes. A health charity partnered with David Beckham to produce a video and voice campaign to help end malaria. In the *malaria no more* campaign, Beckham spoke nine languages seamlessly for public appeal (see video link at end of the deck).\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_deepfake",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_deepfake\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-03-02T12:56:38.807Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-24T13:20:56.238Z"},related:[{dir:f,id:b},{dir:f,id:c}],links:[{url:d,title:e}]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"what_is_vr","what_is_metaverse","https:\u002F\u002Fyoutu.be\u002FQiiSAvKJIHo","A deepfake video of David Beckham","\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F")));
