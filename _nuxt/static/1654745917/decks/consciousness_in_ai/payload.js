There is no easy definition or way to measure it.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is there a way to measure intelligence",a:"In a way, yes. If a human does some task and a machine can do that same task, we say that the machine exhibits intelligence. \n&nbsp;\n\u003E The Turing Test is often considered a sign of intelligence\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the **Turing** test",a:"In 1950, **Alan Turing** proposed *The Imitation Game* (now called the **Turing Test**), which tests a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour. The premise is: *if a machine acts in a way that is indistinguishable from a person, then it is considered to be intelligent*.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How can such a distinction be made",a:"In this *Imitation game*, a **human evaluator** must decide between A and B, which is the machine and which is the human-based solely on their answers. If the evaluator cannot correctly distinguish the human from the machine, the machine would be considered intelligent.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are there types of AI",a:"Yes, **Artificial Narrow Intelligence** (ANI) and **Artificial General Intelligence** (AGI)\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is **Artificial Narrow Intelligence**",a:"**ANI** is commonly referred to machine intelligence that operates in a **narrow circumstance** under **significant constraints**. The AI that we see in the world today is ANI.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E It is also referred to as **Weak AI**\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is Artificial General Intelligence**",a:"**AGI** implies intellligence similar to human intelligence. This includes **common sense**, **background knowledge**, **transfer learning**, **abstraction**, and **causality**.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E It is also referred to as **Strong AI** \n",showQ:a},{q:"What is **Artificial Consciousness**",a:"AC is beyond AGI. It implies **sentience** and being **self-aware**\n&nbsp;\n\u003E *sentience* is the capacity to experience feeling\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are there types of consciousness",a:"There is no consensus but some Philosophers and Neuroscientists believe there are two types:\n1. **Phenomenal** consciousness: ability to reason and guide behaviour\n2. **Access** consciousness: knowing what it is to be in a particular state\n",showQ:a},{q:"Have machines demonstrated either of these types of consciousness",a:"The **Access** type of consciousness has been seen as something possible with machines.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E It can be said that **driverless cars** *know the state they are* in at any point of time because they *understand* the environment and make decisions.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are human intelligence and machine intelligence the same",a:"No. Not only are there hardware differences between the two, but machine intelligence tends to be very specialised.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E e.g. an pressing-iron knows when to cut off power\n",showQ:a},{q:"What could be examples of machines exhibiting artificial consciousness",a:"**Voice Assistants** and **Humanoid robots** because they are aware of their state in a limited context\n",showQ:a},{q:"How likely are we to witness consciousness in AI",a:"The jury is out there on it.
