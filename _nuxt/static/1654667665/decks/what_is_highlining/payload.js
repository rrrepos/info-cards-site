Between two high points, usually across *mountains* or *ridges*, with a deep *valley* below.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is having a good balance a requirement of highlining",a:"A **strong mental game and mindset** are far more important than the technical and physical ability. It requires *concentration*, *focus* and *immense practice* to perform this walk.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is practice done",a:"In **controlled environments**. One begins at low heights of 2-5 feet across sand pit or soft ground. Then, one progresses to greater heights with no soft ground at the same time building mental ability.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Don't the participants wear protective gear",a:"Yes. They do wear a **harness**. There are two ropes. One is the tensioned one called **main slackline** on which one balances oneself. There is a second *slackened* rope which serves as a backup in case the main rope breaks or tears called the **backup** slackline. The harness is attached to both these lines.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How long is a typical highline walk",a:"It varies usually ranging from 500m to a couple of kms and can take an hour or so.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the longest slackline record",a:"Of about 2.8 kms in Northern Norway in 2018. **Friedi Kuhne** walked for about 2.2kms before wind threw him off balance.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E a link to a short video of this attempt is included at the end of this deck\n",showQ:a},{q:"Do highliners walk **blindfolded** too",a:"Yes.
