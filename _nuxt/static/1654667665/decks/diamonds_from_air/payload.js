Scientists have been able to create diamonds using the **Carbon Dioxide** from the air.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is Carbon Dioxide converted into Diamonds",a:"1. Carbon Dioxide from the air is captured\n2. Carbon is extracted from it\n3. It is purified and crystallised into Diamond\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Diamond is just **crystalline carbon**.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is that why they are called **carbon-negative diamonds**",a:"Yes. The technology behind this production **reduces the carbon footprint** in the atmosphere. Hence the name.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is this the same as **synthetic diamond**",a:"No. Synthetic Diamond is diamond that is produced in a **controlled technological environment** that *replaces the geological processes* that natural diamond requires to create it.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are **Lab-based** diamonds",a:"Same as **Synthetic Diamonds**\n",showQ:a},{q:"In what way are Diamonds from Air different from Lab-based diamonds",a:"Lab-based diamonds still use **fossil fuels** products unlike carbon-negative diamonds which uses the *carbon from the air*!\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are **Imitation Diamonds**",a:"These are materials or stones with **gemological characteristics** similar to those of a diamond\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the problems of traditional diamond mining",a:"- Deforestation\n- Water pollution\n- Worker exploitation\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the benefits of carbon-negative diamonds",a:"1. **Environment friendly**\n2. Natural stones **supply is dwindling** so this becomes a *new source* to meet the growing demand of diamonds\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it cheaper to produce diamonds from air",a:"Current Not. Folks behind this project are hoping that with **subsidies** and **popularity**, the price will reduce\n",showQ:a},{q:"Has anyone started production of such diamonds",a:"A company named **Aether** are offering jewellery made with such diamonds\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fdiamonds_from_air",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fdiamonds_from_air\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-05-12T08:57:51.835Z",updatedAt:"2022-05-12T09:30:08.414Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","digital_denim","hydrogen_powered_cars","carbon_footprint")));
