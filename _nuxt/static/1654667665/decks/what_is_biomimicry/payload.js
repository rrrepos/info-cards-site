So that in case of any *natural disaster* the redundant species (plant or animal) could survive the change even if some others perish. This has been adopted by observing natural habitats.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Was **Velcro®** inspired by Nature",a:"Yes. Plants like Burdock produce seeds that are covered in tiny hooks. These tiny hooks catch on the fur of passing animals, helping the plant disperse its seeds. This inspired Swiss engineer George de Mestral, the inventor of Velcro®, to create a hook that led finally to Velcro.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is an example in Energy",a:"Wind turbines uses wind to generate power. However, there is an area in the blade where no power is generated called **root leakage**. A new design was created that mimics the **kingfisher's beak**, which allows the bird to dive into water while barely making a splash. This is due to the way the bird *pushes the fluid around its beak* as it enters water.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Have new materials been made mimicking nature",a:"Yes. For example, in coastal ecosystems, oysters grab onto one another forming extensive reefs using a glue-like substance. Reefs protect the coastline from erosion. By studying the molecular structure of these glues scientists have been able to create a material similar to the cement structure of oysters having similar strength and rigidity.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How did the Lotus plant help innovate nanotechnology",a:"Lotus plants remain clean because the surface of their leaves are water-repellent, or **hydrophobic**. On examination of these leaves, scientists found that they have tiny nanoscale bumps that make a water droplet form a spherical shape that rolls off. This led to **Lotus-inspired paints** and **stain-repellant upholstery**.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are honeycomb structures an example of Biomimicry",a:"Yes. For centuries the honeycomb structure has inspired product design. Depending on the material used it has excellent **strength-weight** ratio. Hence it is popularly used in aerospace, construction, furniture design and in recent times popularly seen in 3D-printing.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the advantages of Biomimicry",a:"1. It brings **relief** because there is hope in solving some of the planets existential problems\n2. It helps us **design generously** because we can create conditions conduicive to life\n3. It helps build **sustainable solutions** faster because we are adapting proven solutions found in nature\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the elements of Biomimicry",a:"1. **Emulate**: Learning from nature and adapting them to our needs\n2. **Ethos**: Understanding the philosophy of life and adopting them in our design\n3. **Connect with Nature**: by observing it and understand it better\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is Biomimicry same as Bioinspired design",a:"Biomimicry is a type of Bioinspired design, not all bioinspired design is biomimicry\n&nbsp;\n\u003E In Biomimicry the emphasis is on learning from and emulating the **regenerative solutions** from living systems  \n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_biomimicry",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_biomimicry\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-04-04T04:54:38.216Z",updatedAt:"2022-06-06T04:12:10.460Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[{url:f,title:g},{url:h,title:i}]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","robobees","medical_nanorobots","what_are_xenobots","https:\u002F\u002Fbiomimicry.org","Biomimicry Institute","https:\u002F\u002Fasknature.org","Ask Nature")));
