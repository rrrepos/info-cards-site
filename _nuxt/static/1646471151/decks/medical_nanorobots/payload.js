They can replicate themselves to correct a genetic deficiency or replace DNA molecule to eradicate disease.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can they be swallowed like a capsule",a:"Yes. Some variations of nanorobots, the size of a capsure, have a camera that shows the internals of the body was it moves along.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can the doctor control the movement of such a robot",a:"Yes. The doctor has control. The nanorobot could have the ability to inject small doses of medicines as well as take a piece of tissue to conduct a biopsy later. This is after it gets excreted out like the normal excretion from our body.\n",showQ:a},{q:"So it is literally a case of *swallow the surgeon*",a:"Yes, that famous quote of the great Physicist, **Richard Feynman**, in his 1959 essay (*There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom*). It is said that in some ways he was responsible for the research and invention of Nanorobots based on the above essay\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can Nanorobots be injected by a syringe",a:"Yes.
