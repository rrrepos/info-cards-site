Play games on a virtual playground or arena\n2. Learn in a virtual classroom\n3. Train to operate virtual machines\n4. Just hang around in an area and socialise with people\n5. Buy property!\n",showQ:a},{q:"Who coined the word",a:"It was first described in the 1992 novel **Snow Crash** by Neal Stephenson\n",showQ:a},{q:"When did it all start",a:"Technology is usually built bit by bit and Metaverse is no different. Virtual online communities were built in the early 2000s. *Second Life* in 2003 being one of the most popular.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why is Metaverse getting popular now",a:"Time is ripe due to progress in:\n- 5G networks\n- more computing power and memory in small devices\n- coming of age of and VR and AR\n- need to work remotely\n",showQ:a},{q:"Do we need special equipment to participate in Metaverse",a:"1. A desktop or notebook computer\n2. A Virtual Reality (VR) headset for an immersive experience\n3. Tactile Gloves will help feel objects in this  world\n4. Wrist sensors to feel sensation (e.g. *Bow & Arrow games*) \n5. Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses to interact with objects\n",showQ:a},{q:"Do I need to walk at home to move in the virtual world",a:"No! That would be disastrous. There are a number of ways this is accomplished\n1. Using the keyboard one can move in two directions\n2. People wear a harness around them and walk like in a treadmill\n3. In some cases, you may just point to a place and you get teleported there\n",showQ:a},{q:"How would we use the keyboard to move",a:"For example:\n1. Moving the up and down arrow takes you forward or backward\n2. Similarly the left and right arrow moves you left or right\n3. Perhaps, a shift + left will turn your view to the left\n\nWhile keyboard equivalents are available, having a VR headset makes the experience immersive. \n",showQ:a},{q:"How do we focus or point to an object",a:"Just like we have a cursor on a normal computer, so is the case with a Metaverse world. \n1. The cursor can be pointed to an object and clicked to select via a mouse.\n2. Or if one uses a headset, then we turn in the desired direction and position the cursor on that object and tap on a button on the side of the headset. \n",showQ:a},{q:"Can we move objects in Metaverse",a:"Yes, this is much like in the physical world, where using the hand gloves, you could touch objects, move them, lift them and place them elsewhere\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can we speak to others in Metaverse",a:"Yes. You would need a mic and a speaker to talk and listen to others, similar to how we use them in a video conferencing session.\n&nbsp;\nMany of the VR headsets have inbuilt speakers and mikes attached.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Then, how is it different from video conferencing",a:"It is 3D and the experience gives you a feeling of being in the other place\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can we see the other person like we do in a video",a:"No. Everyone is represented by an **avatar**. Though many create avatars which have a resemblance to their own self.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How are avatars created similar to oneself",a:"Avatar creation softwares are available that take a bunch of snaps from different positions or using a camera to create an avatar. These avatars have a fair resemblance to the person. Once made, it can be kept as an indentity for all worlds.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Would not people make avatars that are different from how they look",a:"Yes. And very often that is the case. In fact, one of the likely reasons for its popularity is that a person can be a very **different** one in this virtual world. \n",showQ:a},{q:"Why are people buying space in Metaverse worlds",a:"All real estate investments are for two purposes:\n1. To stay or enjoy the property\n2. As investment to sell it when it appreciates\n\n&nbsp;\nIn the case of Metaverse it is the latter.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is this similar to the **Real Player One** movie",a:"Yes. The movie which was based on the book by *Ernest Cline* explored how people escape the problems of earth by going into a virtual world!\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_metaverse",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_metaverse\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-01-31T12:46:08.820Z",updatedAt:"2022-02-01T09:16:31.593Z"},related:[{dir:d,id:b},{dir:d,id:c}]}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}(true,"what_is_nft","what_is_blockchain_ledger","\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F")));
