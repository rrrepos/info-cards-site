A Lidar sensor emits light waves from a **laser** into the environment \n2. These pulses **bounce off** surrounding objects and return to the sensor\n3. The sensor uses the **time** it took for each pulse to return to the sensor to calculate the distance it traveled\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is a Laser",a:"A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification\n&nbsp; \n\u003E **LASER**: is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\"\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is LIDAR similar to RADAR",a:"Yes, in the sense that they do similar tasks but work in different ways because they do not use the same wavelength type\n&nbsp;\n\u003E **RADAR** is Radio Detection and Ranging\n",showQ:a},{q:"What about SONAR, is LIDAR similar to it",a:"Again, SONAR too has the same objective of measuring distance but uses a different medium viz sound waves\n&nbsp;\n\u003E **SONAR** is Sound Navigation and Ranging\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is Lidar better than Radar and Sonar",a:"LiDAR uses lasers with a much lower wavelength than the radio waves used by RADAR. Thanks to this, LiDAR has better accuracy and precision, which allows it to detect smaller objects and create 3D models.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is the 3D model creation helpful",a:"It can be used to now predict whether the object is, say, a **tree**, **person** or a **wall** \n",showQ:a},{q:"Why has Lidar become popular",a:"Because it is an important component of self-driving cars\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is Lidar used in cars",a:"Autonomous cars usually have a unit on its roof that houses the Lidar unit. It continuously emits pulses to determine all the objects relative to the position of the car in 3D.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How **small** an object can a Lidar placed on a car see",a:"Tests have shown that they can detect even the hand signal given by a cyclist!\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can Lidar *see through* walls",a:"No. The pulses emitted by the laser will bounce off the wall \n",showQ:a},{q:"Which are some of the other applications where Lidar is being used",a:"1. **Agriculture**: It can reveal topography including fields, slopes, farmland etc\n2. **Mining**: To evaluate periodic scans of ore removal\n3. **Surveying**: Flights fitted with Lidars can quickly scan vast areas \n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the disadvantages of using Lidar",a:"1. Its high cost\n2. Its inability to measure distance through heavy rain, snow, and fog \n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_lidar",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_lidar\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-03-07T06:11:26.875Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-07T06:55:39.235Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","quantum_computers","iot","what_is_hyperloop")));
