Reports reveal that the LTO industry shipped 148 Exabytes (EB) of total tape capacity (compressed) in 2021. That is 40% more tapes than 2020.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E 1 Exabyte is a **1 billion** Gigabytes\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is tape storage used for in today's cloud environments",a:"As a **backup** that should not be available online\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why is tape storage still preferred as a backup medium",a:"1. **Lower costs** that other storage solutions\n2. Being an **offline** medium, it can be stored behind an *air gap* out of reach of criminals\n3. It has the **least error rate** amongst all data storage mediums\n4. It can quickly be restored due to online media\n",showQ:a},{q:"How much of a cost savings does it offer",a:"Estimates made over a 10 year period show that LTO technology is **86%** lower than all-disk solutions and **66%** lower than cloud storage solutions\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the life-span of a LTO tape",a:"It is usually quoted to be **30 years**\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the format in which the data is stored",a:"The format is called **Ultrium** and uses a single-reel cartridge to store data\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the storage capacity of a LTO tape",a:"The latest generation of tapes store **18TB** in a single tape\n&nbsp;\n\u003E 1 Terabyte is 1000 Gigabytes \n",showQ:a},{q:"Does LTO support encryption",a:"Yes.
