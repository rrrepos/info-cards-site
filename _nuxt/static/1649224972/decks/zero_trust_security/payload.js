With digital transformation accelerating growth and with remote working and cloud based architectures, it is becoming more imperative to seek validation of users and controlling their access to data at every stage\n",showQ:a},{q:"Who coined the term **Zero Trust Security**",a:"It was coined in **April 1994** by **Stephen Paul Marsh** in his doctoral *thesis on computer security*\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the important steps in building a zero trust security model",a:"1.

Strong user authentication\n2. Machine authentication\n3. User Authorisation to applications\n4. Application Authorisations to Users\n5.
