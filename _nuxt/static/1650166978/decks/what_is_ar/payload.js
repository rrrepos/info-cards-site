This is via AR technology.\n",showQ:a},{q:"So it enhances real-world experiences in a way",a:"Yes. In short, it allows you to interact with that object the camera focuses on. These include:\n1. Giving information on the screen\n2. Playing a video or audio related to that object\n3. Or simply offering a menu from which to choose one or many options\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does it work",a:"1. The system captures the image to where the camera is pointed\n2. Shares it with a software running either on the device or an internet server\n3. An AI algorithm recognises (a best estimate) the object.\n4. That results in information being put out about that object\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the uses of AR",a:"1. Classroom Education\n2. Medical Training\n3. Repair and Maintenance of equipment\n4. Retailing when browsing articles\n5. Tourism\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is this not similar to QR codes",a:"Yes, in the sense that an image is used to identify the product. Except that in a QR code system, someone will have to create a code for every object and place it near the object to be scanned. In the case of AR, you simple scan the object.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are AR glasses",a:"These are spectacles that serve the same function that the camera of a mobile does. Wearing it, the user can focus on an object, and visible on the lens will be information about it.",showQ:a},{q:"Where does the AR system get this information form",a:"The AR system has a software running that gives it its ability. \n&nbsp;\nFor example, a *classroom AR based system*, will send the image or the identified object to a server on the internet which retrieves the required information. Just like any other app.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is AR different from VR (Virtual Reality)",a:"The two are *complementing* technologies. (*There is a separate deck on VR*).\n&nbsp;\nAR enhances real world objects with additional digital information while VR takes you to an interactive and immersive virtual world.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can AR and VR co-exist",a:"Yes. In a VR-based virtual world, one can *point* at objects which will bring in additional information about that object.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Has AR become popular",a:"Like any new technology, it is being slowly adopted. \n&nbsp;\nOne of the most popular apps is to check how furniture (*provided by a furniture store*) can be placed within the room of your home before making a decision to purchase\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does such an app work",a:"1. Imagine that you have picked an item, *say a sofa*, from the digital store front.\n2. Then, point the AR app to a part of the room where you would like to place it.\n3. The app has the ability to measure distances and the space available.\n4. Then, as you place the sofa at the desired place, it can estimate whether it fits or not.\n5. Further, as a consumer, you can check the suitability of the item in the room and try out various uphosteries.\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_ar",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_ar\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-02-04T07:12:03.932Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-24T13:19:25.887Z"},related:[{dir:d,id:b},{dir:d,id:c}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"what_is_vr","what_is_metaverse","\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F")));
