This is in lieu of someone doing the task manually.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What types of processes are suitable as a RPA process",a:"Anything that is routine, repetitive and highly manual\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which are the areas in which RPA processes have successful been used",a:"- Banking and Finance processes\n- Mortgage and Lending process\n- Customer Care automation\n- eCommerce merchandising\n- data extraction from various sources\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the benefits of RPA",a:"- reduced cost\n- increased speed\n- higher accuracy and consistency\n- improved quality\n- scalability of production\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is *screen scrapping* a type of RPA process",a:"Yes. In the early days of RPA, information was *culled* from screens which were *inputted* into backend systems for further processing. Since then, RPAs have got a lot more sophisticated.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is a chatbot an example of RPA",a:"While chatbots are automated processing, it is not considered a RPA since chatbots *interface with a customer*, while RPAs are usually **used by company staff**\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is AI and ML part of RPA",a:"Yes.
