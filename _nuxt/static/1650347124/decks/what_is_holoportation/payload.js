However, with additional cameras the quality of the 3d-model improves\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the type of headsets required for this technology",a:"**Head Mounted Display** (HMD) like the *Hololens* and *HTC Vive*. These are similar to VR headsets.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What sort of bandwidth is required for this technology to work",a:"When the invention began it required very high bandwidths that was possible only in labs. Now it has been reduced to 30-50 Mbps and works over regular WiFi networks.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it similar to VR",a:"No. In VR, all the participants are *transported* to a digital space where they meet one another as **avatars**. In Holoportation, the remote participants *seem to appear* in **your physical space** (as seen through the headset). \n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the uses of Holoportation",a:"**Education** would be a big beneficiary as would other requirements of presence of people without travel. **Training** is another big area of the use of such a technology.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Who invented Holoportation",a:"Microsoft",showQ:a},{q:"When was it launched",a:"It was first demonstrated in 2016\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it commercially available",a:"Not yet due to its high cost. However, some government departments have begun experimenting with it.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Has there been a practical use-case of it",a:"In Oct-2021, astronaut *Thomas Pesquet* onboard the **International Space Station** (ISS) interacted with NASAs flight surgeon, *Dr Josef Schmidt* while he was on **Earth**. This triggered much interest in the technology.\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_holoportation",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_holoportation\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-04-19T04:30:23.691Z",updatedAt:"2022-04-19T05:44:14.093Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","what_is_vr","what_is_hyperloop","sensors_on_breeze")));
