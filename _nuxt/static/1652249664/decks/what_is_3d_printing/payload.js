While 3D print is a type of manufacturing that creates products like toys.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it the same as **Additive** printing",a:"Yes. Because layers of a material are added to make the product.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What type of products are popularly made using 3D printers",a:"- toys\n- equipment frames like bicycle handles\n- sporting goods\n- car components\n- music instruments\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the advantages of 3D printing",a:"Unlike conventional manufacturing, 3D printing can be done:\n- in a small place \u002F workshop (even at home)\n- with minimal investments\n- in small quantities \n- for prototyping product ideas before full-scale production\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is a 3-dimensional product *printed* using a printer",a:"1. The 3D printing process turns a whole object into thousands of tiny little slices or layers\n2. Then, each slice is made from the bottom using special material\n3. Thes tiny layers stick together to form a solid object\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is a 3D printer a special type of printer",a:"Yes. Unlike the normal printers that use ink to apply on the surface of materials like paper, a 3D printer uses certain materials in power form to form the layers of the product.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are some of the materials used",a:"The materials used need to be in powder form with glue.\n1. **Plastic** is the most popular used material\n2. **Metal powders** like Aluminium, Steel etc where strength is required\n3. **Carbon Fibre** used popularly as a coating over plastic\n4. **Graphene** because of its strength and conductivity\n",showQ:a},{q:"How are **instructions** given to make a 3D product",a:"1. 3D printers require a computer to which it is attached\n2. It uses a specialised software called **Computer Aided Design** (CAD)   \n3. The product is designed with the order in which the layers have to be applied\n4. Finally, the printer is loaded with the desired material (*similar to how we load an ink cartridge*)\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is there a limit to what can printed using 3D printers",a:"Yes.\n1. Only certain type of materials are available that can be used\n2. Since it uses an additive technology, only products that will not easily fail (*break, bend or fracture*) by this layer method can be manufactured\n3. There is a limit to the dimensions of what can be printed\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it cheaper to make a product using 3D printing",a:"Depends. It is definitely cheaper when *not-so-large quantities* are to be made and when the product has some *intricate design* where the die costs may be prohibitive.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are some of the newer items being experimented with 3D printing",a:"1. **Houses**: Pre-fabricated houses have been in vogue for a while. Now, these prefab components can be made using 3D printers.\n2. **Car components**: Auto ancilliaries are being made esp with new materials being used in 3D printing\n3. **Jewellery**: Intricate designs can now be made via a computer\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_3d_printing",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_3d_printing\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-02-08T05:39:45.164Z",updatedAt:"2022-04-25T12:57:45.784Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","what_is_4d_printing","what_is_hyperloop","quantum_computers")));
