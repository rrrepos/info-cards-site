This natural Greenhouse effect is why we survive",showQ:a},{q:"Then, why is it considered harmful",a:"Because the amount of heat retained is more than required gradually making the planet warmer which will eventually destroy it\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which are the Greehouse gases",a:"The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are:\n- Water Vapor\n- Carbon Dioxide\n- Methane\n- Nitrous Oxide \n- Ozone \n- Chloroflurocarbons\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which are the major Greenhouse gases that prevent heat from radiating back",a:"1. Carbon Dioxide\n2. Nitrous Oxide\n3. Methane\n4. Chloroflurocarbons\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why is there always mention about Carbon Dioxide",a:"Because that constitutes a major percentage (about 76%) of the GHG",showQ:a},{q:"What happens when the heat is not radiated back",a:"Certain quantity of the heat is required to maintain equitable temperature on earth, but over time because of the increase in these gases the planet has become warmer\n",showQ:a},{q:"What happens if the planet becomes warmer",a:"It contributes to extreme weather, wildfires, droughts and food supply disruptions that may eventually lead to extinction of animal species\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which industries are the major emitters of GHG",a:"1. Power generation via coal\n2. Transportation\n3. Agriculture\n4. Deforestation\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why happens when we use coal",a:"Coal when it is burnt to generate energy releases tremendous amount of Carbon Dioxide. This causes a disproportionate amount of CO2 in the atmosphere causing global warming. This happens with other fossil fuels like petroleum products too.   \n",showQ:a},{q:"How does Agriculture contribute to GHG",a:"1. Cattle herds produce Methane when they gas. Methane is 30 times more potent than CO2.\n2. Crop fertilisers contain Nitrous Oxide which is 300 times more potent than CO2.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does Deforestation increase GHG",a:"Trees, we know, absorb Carbon Dioxide, during the photosynthesis process. This reduces the amount of CO2. However, with large deforestation, the world is denied of this beneficial process.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How can humans reduce GHG",a:"1. Switch to cleaner energy providers\n2. Drive less and walk \u002F cycle more\n3. Wash clothes without using warm water in washing machine to save energy\n4. Eat seasonal or locally produced fruits\u002Fvegs since they have lower transportation costs\n5. Replace light bulbs with energy-efficient ones\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fgreenhouse_gases",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fgreenhouse_gases\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-02-07T11:27:58.038Z",updatedAt:"2022-04-25T12:40:49.237Z"},related:[{dir:d,id:b},{dir:d,id:c}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"carbon_footprint","cop_26","\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F")));
