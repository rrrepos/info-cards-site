Did we have a 1.0 and 2.0",a:"Yes. Web 1.0 is termed for the first phase of internet when the protocols were defined and companies started setting up their web sites.\n&nbsp;\nWeb 2.0 is termed when folks started using the internet for social media apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.\n",showQ:a},{q:"So what is new in Web 3.0",a:"It is an idea where the web content is based on blockchain technology (*separate deck available*) with a decentralisation and token-based economics and is characterised by users creating content viz. blogs, posts, opinions etc.",showQ:a},{q:"So a decentralised web, eh",a:"Yes. Unlikely currently where all the information is available on a single server owned and controlled by the organisation who set up the server, this version will have the content as per the blockchain technology.\n",showQ:a},{q:"And what is the token-based economics mean",a:"That the creators of such a system could offer their content using crypto coins (*separate deck available*) which users may have to furnish to gain access to information.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is wrong with Web 2.0 that needed a change",a:"Some of the ills of the current internet usage are:\n1.

Corporations and \u002F or Government set up the infrastructure required to run the internet servers.\n2. They provide the service usually free or at minimal charges.\n3. In return they capitalise the usage of their service by advertisements and\u002For influencing the users.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How would the decentralised system protect privacy and ownership of content",a:"1. Blockchain distributed system rely on encryption to prevent stealing of information.\n2. This encryption also ensures that only the person who created the data can change it. In short, no manipulation of someone else's data.\n3. The distributed system ensures that no one server can change the content unauthorised; thereby giving it an additional layer of protection.\n4. Lastly, governments cannot access this information and since it is not owned by any corporation, they cannot make requests or enforce access. \n",showQ:a},{q:"Is Metaverse part of Web 3.0",a:"Folks are suggesting that the access to the Web 3.0 content should be via a Metaverse (*separate deck available*) interface\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_web3",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_web3\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-02-07T05:13:44.900Z",updatedAt:"2022-02-07T06:01:45.433Z"},related:[{dir:d,id:b},{dir:d,id:c}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:void 0}}(true,"what_is_blockchain_ledger","what_is_metaverse","\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F")));
