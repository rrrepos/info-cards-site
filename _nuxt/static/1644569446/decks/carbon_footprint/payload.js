A load of laundry washed at room temperature will be **0.6 kg** of CO2e\n2. A new car has a foot print of approximately **9 tonnes** of CO2e\n3.

Small changes can be made. Some of these are:\n1. Consume local (*less transportation*) and seasonal products (*less storage*)\n2. Avoid excessive plastic packaging\n3.
