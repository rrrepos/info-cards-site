Early tests show that the microwave-based beaming can generate more power than laser beaming. As the technology matures other factors will emerge that may favour one over the other.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How much of power can be generated using SBSP",a:"1. **Laser-based beaming** can generate 1-10 MW\n2. **Microwave-based beaming** can generate upto 1 GW\n",showQ:a},{q:"Would the beams transmitted harm humans on earth",a:"No. The designs proposed use energy densities that **do not harm** humans. However, the receiving station antennas need to be **huge**.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is solar power capturing in space better than that on earth",a:"Yes.
