They can replicate themselves to correct a genetic deficiency or replace DNA molecule to eradicate disease.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can they be swallowed like a capsule",a:"Yes. Some variations of nanorobots, the size of a capsule, have a camera that shows the internals of the body along which it moves.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can the doctor control the movement of such a robot",a:"Yes. The doctor has a control. Additionally, the nanorobot could have the ability to inject small doses of medicines as well as take a piece of tissue to examine in the lab.\n",showQ:a},{q:"So it is literally a case of *swallow the surgeon*",a:"Yes, that famous quote of the great Physicist, **Richard Feynman**, in his 1959 essay (*There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom*). It is said that in some ways Feynman was responsible for the research and invention of Nanorobots since it began after he published the above essay\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can Nanorobots be injected by a syringe",a:"Yes.
