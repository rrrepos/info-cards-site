This is called **visible light** or **visible spectrum**. This is for wavelengths from **about 380 to about 750** nanometers.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is limitation of visible spectrum same amongst all animals",a:"No. Some like *cats* have better night vision in comparison to humans.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the principle of night vision devices",a:"There are two approaches:\n1. **Image Enhancement**: amplifying what is not visible to the human eye\n2. **Thermal Imaging**: using heat emitted from objects\n",showQ:a},{q:"What happens in **Image Enhancement**",a:"This works by collecting the **tiny amounts of light**, including the **lower portion** of the infrared light spectrum, not visible to our eyes, and *amplifying it* to the point that we can easily observe the image\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does **Thermal Imaging** work",a:"This works by capturing the **upper portion** of the infrared light spectrum, which is emitted as heat by objects (as opposed to simple reflected light) to compose an image. \n&nbsp;\n\u003E **Hotter** objects, such as warm bodies, emit more of this light than **cooler** objects like trees or buildings.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are the green images we see a result of Image Enhancement",a:"Yes. Using tiny amounts of light from the lower spectrum, it generates images and shows them as **green-tinted** images\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why are they tinted as **green** and not some other color, say, like *black and white*",a:"1. The human eye is more sensitive to light wavelengths that hover around **555 nanometers**, which just so happens to be dominated by the color green\n2. It is much more comfortable and easier for people to stare at a green screen for much longer than they can at a black and white one or any other color\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are the red-orange-yellow images we see a result of Thermal Imaging",a:"Yes. They capture infrared light spectrum and show them in these colors\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is night vision possible in total darkness",a:"Not using Image Enhancement technology. But with Thermal imaging one can see partial images.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Upto what distance can night vision be used to see objects",a:"About 180-200 mts\n",showQ:a},{q:"Of these above two methods of night vision which is popular",a:"Thermal Imaging\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the common applications of night vision",a:"- Military\n- Law Enforcement\n- Wildlife Observation\n- Surveillance\n- Navigation\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is there any new research to improve the quality of night vision",a:"Yes. Researchers have created a prototype of a thin film made of **nano scale crystals** which can *transform infrared light*, normally invisible to the human eye, and turn this into images people can clearly see even at distance. This currently at **proof of concept** stage.\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fnight_vision",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fnight_vision\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-05-05T03:26:14.410Z",updatedAt:"2022-05-05T05:04:53.693Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","what_is_lidar","transparent_solar_panels","what_is_lifi")));
