When cracks happen, the fibers or capsules will break and the liquid contained in them will then heal the crack at once.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Who first invented self healing concrete",a:"Henk Jonkers, a microbiologist and professor at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands began work in 2006 and found the perfect healing agent - **bacillus* after a few years\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why was this bacteria chosen as a healing agent",a:"1. The bacteria will thrive in the high-alkaline conditions of concrete and produce spores that can live up to four years without any food or oxygen\n2. By adding calcium lactate to the limestone concrete mixture, it could feed the bacillus so that they can produce limestone to repair cracks in the concrete\n",showQ:a},{q:"Besides bacteria, what are the other types of self healing concretes available today",a:"1. **Sodium Silicate based**\n2. **Fungus based**\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does the Sodium Silicate-based concrete work",a:"As cracks form in the concrete, the **sodium silicate capsules** rupture and release its contentwhich mix with the concrete, fill the cracks and harden over time\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does the Fungus-based concrete work",a:"In this concrete, the **spores** from the fungus are used. They remain dormant until the first cracks begin to emerge, at which that point they begin to fill these areas in.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the advantages of self healing concrete",a:"1. Do not have to worry about wear and tear\n2. Longer service life\n3. Improves compressive strength of concrete\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why do cracks form in concrete",a:"Concrete by its inherent nature has low tensile strength and so has a tendency to form cracks allowing ingress of water and gases rendering the structure weak\n",showQ:a},{q:"What happens if the cracks continue to exist",a:"Over time, these cracks reach the reinforcement and corrode the steel rods\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is self healing concrete popularly used",a:"Not yet. Efforts are being made to reduce its cost and bring out some standardisation of its constutuents and usage.\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fself_healing_concrete",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fself_healing_concrete\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-03-04T05:22:14.948Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-04T06:12:32.637Z"},related:[{dir:c,id:b},{dir:c,id:d},{dir:c,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"self_healing_concrete","\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","gene_editing","lab_made_dairy_products")));
