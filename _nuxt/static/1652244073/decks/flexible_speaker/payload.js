A loudspeaker uses electric current inputs that pass through a coil of wire\n2. This generates a magnetic field\n3. Which moves a speaker membrane\n4. That moves the air above it\n5. That makes the sound we hear\n",showQ:a},{q:"How differently does the new flexible speaker work",a:"The new developed speaker uses a **thin film** of a *shaped piezoelectric material* that moves when voltage is applied over it, which moves the air above it and generates sound\n",showQ:a},{q:"How much of energy is required in comparison to traditional loudspeakers",a:"Just a fraction. It requires about **100 millwatts** per sq meter of speaker area in comparison to about **1 watt** which is consumed by traditional speakers for the same decibel level.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does the surface on which the speaker is bonded to matter",a:"No. Tests so far have shown that it can produce high quality sound no matter where it is bonded\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are some of the use-cases of this technology",a:"1. **Immersive experiences** like 3D audio in theme parks\n2. **Smart devices** applications\n",showQ:a},{q:"What was the hurdle that the researchers needed to overcome",a:"Traditionally speakers are designed to be free-standing because the film must bend freely to make sound. To overcome this, they designed **tiny domes** on a thin layer piezoelectric material that could **vibrate independently**. In such a way that when the speaker material is bonded to a surface it *does not interfere* with the vibration.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does this mean that each dome produces a sound",a:"Yes, each is a **sound producing unit**\n",showQ:a},{q:"How small are these domes",a:"About **15 microns** (*1\u002F6th the thickness of human hair*)!\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can these domes be of different sizes",a:"Yes, the larger domes produce more sound of lower frequency\n",showQ:a},{q:"And the whole speaker has many such domes",a:"Yes, and together they generate sound that is audible\n&nbsp;\n\u003E a video link has been given at the end of this deck posted by the research team at MIT\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it commercially available",a:"Not yet.
