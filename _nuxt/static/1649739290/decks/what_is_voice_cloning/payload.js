Unlike voice cloning which sounds as though a specific individual has spoken\n",showQ:a},{q:"So how is this cloning done",a:"Thanks to the advancement of AI, a person can **train** a system to be able to generate one's voice in a short time. And the more one trains, the better is the quality of the generated voice.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How exactly does this work",a:"Many voice samples with the spoken text can be inputted to an AI (Machine Learning) algorithm that will process the data and create a **ML model** that can be used to generate voice from a given text\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the benefits of voice cloning",a:"1. Increased opportunities for voice artists and celebrities\n2. Revive voices from the past to relive historical stories\n3. Localise content in voices that people in a region are familiar with\n4. People who have lost their voices can still *record* new content from past recordings\n",showQ:a},{q:"Would not voice cloning be dangerous like fake news",a:"Yes. In the sense that one could **publish** controversial statements purportedly made by a known person. This could trigger backlashes against that person when the person would never have made such a statement.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it same as **Deep Fake Voice**",a:"Yes. **Voice Cloning** is the technology but often given the notorious name *Deep Fake Voice* because the **voice** is fake and generated by a **deep** neural network.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is a **Deep Neural Network**",a:"It is a type of Machine Learning Tool to make predictions; in this case predicting how a given text would be spoken by somone.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is Voice cloning same as **Digital cloning**",a:"Digital cloning could mean cloning of any digital asset: voice, photos, or videos\n",showQ:a},{q:"What has made voice cloning popular now",a:"The availability of:\n1. Powerful hardware with cloud computing capabilities to process and render the data\n2. Extensive training data of the targetted voice\n3. More effective algorithms that uses modern concepts like deep neural networks\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_voice_cloning",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_voice_cloning\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-04-11T06:15:17.002Z",updatedAt:"2022-04-11T07:00:23.765Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","what_is_deepfake","robobees","what_is_4d_printing")));
