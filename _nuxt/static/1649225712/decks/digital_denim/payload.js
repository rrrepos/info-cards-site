Cotton is gathered\n2. Then, put into machines and spun together into strong threads\n3. The threads are dipped several times into tubs of indigo dye\n4. The indigo threads are woven together\n5. The denim is then *sanforized*, i.e. stretched, heated, and shrunk down\n",showQ:a},{q:"So it is step 2 that consumes lots of water",a:"Yes, the repeated wash is required to give the faded look that is so typical of a denim\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is digital denim made",a:"In this method, the ink jet printer drops textile colourants onto the surface of the fabric\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is this similar to how digital prints are made on Tees",a:"Yes. Except that the *type of ink jet printer* and the quality of the *colourants* are different and suitable to give a denim look\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the advantages of digital denim",a:"1. It uses less water\n2. It uses less energy\n3. It is a print-on-demand process\n4. It is easy to create a denim of any color\n",showQ:a},{q:"What about the thickness of the denim",a:"For this process, one would choose pre-treated fabric that has the same weight and texture as the traditional jean samples\n",showQ:a},{q:"In what way is digital printing in clothing industry an advantage over conventional methods",a:"To print using the traditional process, as you increase the number of colors, you increase the cost of the cloth. In Inkjet printing costs are not a function of the number of colors but just the area of printing.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is the faded look achieved in digital denims",a:"High resolution images of denim samples are taken and then these get transferred to the fabric\n",showQ:a},{q:"How close is the digital denim to the original denim",a:"One of the teams, led by *Lisa Chapman* and *Ming Wang* of the North Carolina University, showed samples to industry experts and the following were their findings:\n1. **On color**: on a scale of 1-5 (five being closest), the digital denims scored a 3.\n2. **On texture**: good match\n3. **On lightness**: good match\n4. **On line quality**: not a good match\n",showQ:a},{q:"What was the single most unmatching feature between the two denims",a:"The **penetration** of the color. On digital denims the colors is *kind of* on the surface while with traditional dye printing it gets absorbed in the underlying fabric.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are digital denims available commercially",a:"Not yet as per reports. Labs are researching to remove some of the drawbacks to make it a commercial success given the environment benefits it will bring.\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fdigital_denim",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fdigital_denim\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-03-20T04:52:56.445Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-24T13:07:16.127Z"},related:[{dir:d,id:b},{dir:d,id:c}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"lab_made_dairy_products","carbon_footprint","\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F")));
