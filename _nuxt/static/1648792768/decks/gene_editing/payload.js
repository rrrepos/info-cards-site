In gene editing, a mutated gene is revised, removed, or replaced at the DNA level. In gene therapy, the effect of a mutation is offset by inserting a *healthy* version of the gene.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What types of diseases can be corrected by Gene Editing",a:"**Genetic diseases**, which are conditions caused by one or more mutations in the genome",showQ:a},{q:"What are some of these diseases",a:"Gene Theraphy targets rare diseases for which effective treatment options are not available:\n1. Hemophilia\n2. Cystic Fibrosis\n3. Muscular Dystrophy\n4. Sickle Cell Anemia\n5. beta-thalassemia\n",showQ:a},{q:"At what age is Gene theraphy administered",a:"The earlier the better. Usually under the age of 18. \n&nbsp;\n\u003E It depends on the changes being done to the DNA\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is Gene editing done before the birth of a child",a:"Yes. **Prenatal Gene Theraphy** is easily done and more effective.
