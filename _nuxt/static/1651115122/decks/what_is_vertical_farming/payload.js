His concept was to grow food in urban areas thereby saving distance and time in bringing the food from rural areas to the cities.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E The word was coined by **Gilbert Ellis Bailey** in 1915 when he wrote a book titled **Vertical Farming**\n",showQ:a},{q:"How are crops grown in vertical farms",a:"Crops are grown **indoors**, under artificial conditions of light and temperature. It aims at **higher productivity** in smaller spaces using soil-less methods such as *hydroponics, aquaponics* and *aeroponics*.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is **Hydroponics**",a:"It is a method of growing food in **water** using mineral nutrient solutions without soil\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is Aquaponics",a:"It is the technique of growing plants without soil, to create symbiotic relationships between the plants and the **fish** (referred to as *fish farming*)\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is Aeroponics",a:"In Aeroponics, there is *no growing medium* and hence, no containers for growing crops. In aeroponics, **mist or nutrient solutions** are used instead of water. As the plants are tied to a support and roots are sprayed with nutrient solution, it requires very less space, very less water and no soil. It was designed by NASA as a way to grow plants in space.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which crops are suitable for vertical farms",a:"1. Greens like: *lettuce, coriander, spinach, basil*\n2. Corn\n3. Cabbage\n4. Okra\n5. Sprouts\n",showQ:a},{q:"Do vertical farms require less water",a:"Yes. This is because the water is **re-cycled** and there is minimal use of pesticides\n&nbsp;\n\u003E it uses 90% lesser water than soil based farming\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the disadvantages of vertical farming",a:"1. High initial costs\n2. Operation costs higher due to energy requirements\n3. Limited crops can be grown\n4. Calorie content is lesser than traditional farming\n5. Higher skills required since it is new\n6. Pollination is more difficult \n",showQ:a},{q:"If vertical farming has high energy requirements is it eco-friendly",a:"Only if **renewable energy sources** like solar are used\n",showQ:a},{q:"When and where was the first commercial vertical farms opened",a:"In Singapore in 2012\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which countries are practicing vertical farming",a:"- Japan\n- China\n- Korea\n- Singapore\n- Thailand\n- Denmark\n- US\n- Germany\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_vertical_farming",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_vertical_farming\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-04-04T11:23:02.919Z",updatedAt:"2022-04-25T13:39:45.896Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","what_is_hydroponics","lab_based_dairy_products","self_fertilizing_crops")));
