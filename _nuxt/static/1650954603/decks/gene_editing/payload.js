In gene editing, a mutated gene is revised, removed, or replaced at the DNA level. In gene therapy, the effect of a mutation is offset by inserting a *healthy* version of the gene.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What types of diseases can be corrected by Gene Editing",a:"**Genetic diseases**, which are conditions caused by one or more mutations in the genome",showQ:a},{q:"What are some of these diseases",a:"Gene Theraphy targets rare diseases for which effective treatment options are not available:\n1.
