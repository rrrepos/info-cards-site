It is a wireless communication that aims to use light to transmit information from point A to point B\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does it work",a:"The technology works by encoding digital data and turning LED bulbs on and off faster than humans can notice to transfer it. The light then travels to a photoreceptor, which can decode and translate the data to a more classic radio frequency (WiFi, or 4G or 5G).\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is the transmission of data faster",a:"Yes, its theroretical speeds are aboput 100Gbit\u002Fs, more than 5 times faster than WiFi (5G)\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is WiFi wireless different from LiFi wireless",a:"WiFi uses radio frequencies while LiFi uses visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light frequencies\n",showQ:a},{q:"In what way is it different from WiFi",a:"1. LiFi is based on light frequency while WiFi is based on radio frequency\n2. The light source and receptor should be in close proximity unlike WiFi, which can pass through walls\n3. LiFi range is much more limited than WiFi\n4. Chances of interference is more in LiFi over WiFi\n",showQ:a},{q:"Since LiFi can connect devices within the same room is it not limiting",a:"Yes. But the silver lining is that people cannot stealthily piggy back on a connection\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it similar to Fibre Optics",a:"Yes, in the sense that the fibre optic cables uses light to transmit data. But LiFi is a wireless communication.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are there applications where it would be better suited over WiFi",a:"Yes, in **electromagnetic sensitive areas** such as in aircraft cabins, hospitals and nuclear power plants where data transfer can be done without causing electromagnetic interference\n",showQ:a},{q:"One hears of **spectrum crisis** in the context of Wireless data. Will that change with LiFi",a:"Yes. WiFi uses radio frequencies which are close to full capacity, LiFi on the other hand uses visible light frequencies which are 10,000 times larger than radio waves \n",showQ:a},{q:"Who coined the word LiFi",a:"Harald Haas coined during a TED talk in 2011\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it commercically being used",a:"Not yet. Technology is being perfected and prices of photoreceptors need to come down to make it commercially viable.\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_lifi",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_lifi\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-03-04T12:14:10.530Z",updatedAt:"2022-04-25T13:05:55.388Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","quantum_computers","iot","gene_editing")));
