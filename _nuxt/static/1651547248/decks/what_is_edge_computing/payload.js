This data needs to be processed within the car itself to make split second decisions. This is an example of edge computing.\n",showQ:a},{q:"If not edge computing what is the alternative",a:"The data could be sent to remote servers on some internet cloud that would process it and give back the result. However, in some use-cases that would be fatal or useless because it is too late.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What devices can have edge computing",a:"Almost any device. **Mobiles phones** have enough power to achieve some amount of edge computing and for the rest send it to cloud servers. Most **IoTs** (Internet of Things) devices have some edge computing capabilities.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the advantages of edge computing",a:"1. **Low latency**: since the data is being processed locally, the system does not rely on networks for getting results\n2. **Higher security**: since the data is not transferred to a remote location like a cloud server\n3. **Reduced costs**: since no data or partial data is sent to remote servers\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are there some types of computing that cannot be done on the edge",a:"1. It could be possible that the **computing power** required to process the data is not possible at the device.\n2. At times, the data collected from the source has to be **analysed** in conjunction with all **historic data**. Again something that would not be able at source.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are examples of edge computing tasks that are done at closer to the source of data",a:"1. **IoT cameras** are used to *measure foot falls*\n2. **Display** of *air pollution data* on Digital Boards\n3. **Drones** flying over vast lands to identify *pest infestations*\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why has edge computing gained importance in recent times",a:"The tremendous **increase in computing power** and storage that is available in a small chip is making edge computing an **important strategy** in deployment of technology.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which industries are popularly deploying edge computing",a:"1. Agriculture\n2. Autonomous vehicles\n3. Enegry\n4. Health\n5. Retail\n6.
