In fact, steel making is estimated to contribute to about 7-9% of world carbon emissions\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is the process of **green steel** different",a:"It uses one that reduces the use of carbon. Various methods are being tried out. The one that has been more successful is replacing carbon by **hydrogen**.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does Hydrogen help purify iron ore",a:"The hydrogen, *freed from water*, reacts with the oxygen in ore at high temperatures, with fossil-free wind energy and hydropower. This releases **hydrogen and water**, instead of *carbon dioxide*. The resulting **sponge iron** melts in an electric arc furnace with a **small amount** of carbon to create steel.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How much of carbon emission does this process release",a:"Less than **2%** of the coke-based methods\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is green steel commercially used today",a:"No. It is expected to take about 5 more years to be commercially available and replace existing methods of making steel.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is there any industry where its use is being tested",a:"Yes. The **Volvo** car manufacturing has begun to use it for their *mining and quarrying* vehicle starting Oct-2021\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which companies are making green steel today",a:"A Swedish industrial consortium have announced the development of a green steel called **Hybrit**\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_green_steel",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_green_steel\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-04-21T02:36:39.837Z",updatedAt:"2022-04-25T13:03:12.524Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","sustainable_aviation_fuel","hydrogen_powered_cars","air_quality_db_2022")));
