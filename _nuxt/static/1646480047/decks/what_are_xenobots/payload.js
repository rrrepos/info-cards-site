That is why they are referred to as **living robots**!\n",showQ:a},{q:"What makes a robot *a living one*",a:"To persist **life must reproduce**. For billions of years plants, animals, viruses have learnt the art of replicating. A Xenobot has capability to replicate and reproduce!\n&nbsp;\n\u003E often referred as a **living programmable organism**\n",showQ:a},{q:"When was the first Xenobot invented",a:"The xenobots were first designed in 2020 on a supercomputer at the University of Vermont and then assembled and tested by biologists at Tufts University in Massachusetts\n",showQ:a},{q:"Who were the team that build it They were built by Douglas Blackiston according to blueprints generated by an AI program, which was developed by Sam Kriegman and Michael Levin, a Professor of Biology",showQ:a},{q:"What material are xenobots made of",a:"Stem cells of the African Clawed Frog\n",showQ:a},{q:"How big is a Xenobot",a:"about 1mm wide",showQ:a},{q:"What is the process by which baby xenobots are created",a:"Baby xenobots were created by a process called **kinetic replication**. \n&nbsp;\n\u003E Using artificial intelligence, the xenobots were turned into c-shape (*think of PacMan*) robots. When put into a petri dish, the c-shaped xenobots were able to gather hundreds of tiny stem cells inside its mouth... creating new xenobots a few days later.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Do Xenobots respond to stimuli",a:"No. Yet they are described by scientists as \"lifeforms\" since:\n- they can feed off of energy supplied by their cells\n- move with intent\n- repair their injuries \n- build other xenobots\n",showQ:a},{q:"Do they have a brain and other organs like other organisms have",a:"No. They have no brain or digestive system or other conventional organs\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the primary use of Xenobots",a:"To understand how cells build things and how they go out of control. It could lead scientists to understand and prevent rogue cells from causing diseases like cancer\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the other potential uses of Xenobots",a:"These are early days for Xenobots. Scientists and Researchers are betting on the primary characteristic of xenobots which is to **corral a group of cells**. This will help confine them to perform different tasks like say *clean micro-plastics from the ocean*\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can Xenobots be used in Medicine like Nanobots",a:"Yes. Xenobots could potentially be used to create patient specific cells that deliver drugs wherever intended, bypassing the challenges associated with other ways to deliver cells\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_are_xenobots",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_are_xenobots\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-03-05T10:40:59.882Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-05T11:28:41.253Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e},{dir:b,id:f}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","What are Xenobots","medical_nanorobots","self_fertilizing_crops","what_is_robotic_surgery")));
