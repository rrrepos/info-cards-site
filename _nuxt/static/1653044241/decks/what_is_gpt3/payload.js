In the case of GPT, massive amounts of *internet data* was used.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the type of text outputs that GPT can generate",a:"1. Creation of text\n2. Conversations\n3. Text Summarization\n4. Question-Answering\n5. Programming code!\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are its **Text Creation** capabilities",a:"Given a small initiation text of a few words or sentences, the GPT system can generate large quantities of:\n- articles on the topic\n- blogs\n- stories\n- news reports\n- poetry\n",showQ:a},{q:"Poetry? Can it generate in the style of an old poet",a:"Yes. It is particularly good at that! ... *Shakespeare*, *Edgar Allen Poe* etc\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does the **text summarizations** capabilities include **text simplification**",a:"Yes. For example, giving a command like: **summarize this for a second-grade student** followed by the text will create an appropriate summary with vocabulary suitable for a second-grader\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can GPT answer questions asked in normal language",a:"Yes. These can be general questions that are available in the **public domain**, or can be questions from a **passage** that you have provided.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does the Q&A capabilities include multiple choice questions too",a:"Yes. It has the *intelligence* to guess alternatives for the multiple choice!\n",showQ:a},{q:"Will GPT-3 replace programmers",a:"Probably not. But definitely it can ease the effort of writing a program. Some folks have demonstrated the **creation of a website** by tasking it to GPT3.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Check the **low code no code** deck linked at the end of this deck\n",showQ:a},{q:"Who has created GPT-3",a:"**The OpenAI**, an AI Research and deployment Company\n",showQ:a},{q:"What sort of complexity and size is the GPT-3 model built on",a:"GPT-3 is built on a model with **175 billion parameters** on about **45 TB** of data\n&nbsp;\n\u003E A **parameter** is something that is required by the model to predict data and is available in the training data e.g. *number of words in a sentence* or *no of adjectives* etc\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does this mean that GPT-3 models have **knowledge** or **intelligence** as we commonly know",a:"No. The model itself has no knowledge, it is just good at **predicting the next word(s)** in the sequence.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does GPT-3 support all languages",a:"Since a majority of the training data was in English, it performs much better in English over other languages. However, it does support a number of other languages\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is the output of a GPT generated text always correct and without bias",a:"No. Remember that GPT has no **absolute knowledge** of anything. It's output is based on the training data on which the model has been created. Hence if that data is biased or abusive, so would be the output of some task given to it.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the uses of GPT-3",a:"1. Support teams can use them for customer questions (chat bots)\n2. Marketing teams can use them for copy and collateral generation\n3. Teachers can use them to create exam question papers\n4. Students can use them for topic summaries\n",showQ:a},{q:"What was the training data for GPT-1 and GPT-2",a:"1. GPT-1 released in 2018 had 117 million parameters\n2. GPT-2 released in 2019 had 1.5 billion parameters\n3. GPT-3 release in 2020 had 175 billion parameters\n&nbsp;\n\u003E number of parameters is a measure of the complexity of the model and results in better generation of output\n",showQ:a},{q:"Will there be a GPT-4",a:"In all likelihood.
