Usually they illuminate from the back of the LCD display panel.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is not most of the ebook readers black and white display",a:"Yes. Black and White e-ink displays are the ones used in all ebook readers\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is Color e-ink a new technology",a:"Yes, and is not commercially popular yet. Scientists are working on creating vibrant colors that brings all the advantages of e-ink technology to the user.\n",showQ:a},{q:"When was the first color e-ink technology introduced",a:"In 2016 aimed at Signages\n&nbsp;\n\u003E The first commercial e-ink display was launched in 2007\n",showQ:a},{q:"In what way are e-ink displays better than LCDs",a:"1. It is closer to natural reading\n2. It consumes very less battery power\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why is reading on an e-ink better than conventional digital displays",a:"Because it mimics the appearance of **ink on paper** which reduces eye strain\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does reading on e ink paper reduce eye strain",a:"This is because it doesn't reduce **our blink rate** unlike LCD displays\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why does e-ink displays consume less power",a:"This is because these displays require power only to **change content** on the display but not to display the content unlike backlit displays that require the illumination at all times\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the technology behind e-ink display",a:"1. These displays have tiny **microcapsules** that are suspended in a liquid that is encased within a film layer.\n2. When these microcapsules receive a positive charge, they are white in color and they become black when a negative charge is applied.\n3. Once applied it remains in that state till the values are changed\n",showQ:a},{q:"What happens when content is changed",a:"All the microcapsules in the display unit are changed to either positive or negative state based on the content and layout of the page. To do this, it requires power. However, when the user is reading the page, there is no power required since there are no changes to the page.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does this mean that it consumes battery power only when we **turn** a page",a:"Yes. Because all the microcapsules need to get reset based on the new page's content.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How long does the battery last on an e-book readers",a:"This is of course based on usage. But usually it lasts in weeks unlike mobiles which run out of power within a day!\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why is color e-ink not popular",a:"The technology has been more difficult to *crack*. Several versions have been released, but they seem unsatisfactory in terms of quality of display vis-a-vis power required\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the limitation of e-ink technology",a:"1. Today, it is largely black and white\n2. It needs light to fall on it to be visible (*which is good in a way*) but that prevents reading something in darkness (unlike mobile phones)\n3. Videos cannot be played using this technology\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fcolored_eink_display",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fcolored_eink_display\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-04-12T06:51:27.196Z",updatedAt:"2022-04-25T12:33:11.479Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","digital_denim","bionic_eyes","smart_cane")));
