Just like Light is made up of **wavelengths** of light, and each wavelength is of a **particular colour**\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the frequency of sound waves that humans can hear",a:"20 Hz to 20,000 Hz\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the types of noises",a:"1. White\n2. Pink\n3. Brown\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is **White noise**",a:"It is noise that contains **all frequencies** across the spectrum *in equal measure*. It is a random noise with no pattern as such.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it like the noise we hear from an untuned TV",a:"Yes, people refer to this familar static noise from an untuned radio or TV as white noise\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why is noise categorised using light colors",a:"It seemed easy to give a name similar to how light at different spectrums have color. Thus *White noise* is all frequencies in random similar to how *White light* is equal power to all light frequencies.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are **examples** of White noise",a:"- Television static\n- Fan noise\n- Humming of an AC unit \n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the **benefits** of White noise",a:"1. Sound **masking**\n2. Managing **Tinnitus**\n3. Increasing **concentration**\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is **Pink noise**",a:"It is an **ambient sound** usually played in the background to cancel other noises that interferes with sleep or disturbs concentration\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Ambient sound is sound that is not being monitored\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is Pink noise a **low-frequency sound**",a:"Yes. It is a **softer** and **more mild** version of White noise\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does nature produce pink noises",a:"Yes, in the form of:\n- wind rustling through trees\n- steady rain\n- rustling of leaves\n- waves on a beach\n- heartbeats\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the **benefits** of Pink noise",a:"1. **Fall asleep** faster\n2. **Stay asleep** longer\n3. **Block** outside noises\n4. **Improve** memory\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why does Pink noise help sleep",a:"Because it **masks the sound** that usually disturbs us e.g. a dog barking, or a TV being played loud\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does Pink noise follow a pattern",a:"Yes. Folks describe it as a **pattern** that falls somewhere between *pure randomness and correlated movement*\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is **Brown noise**",a:"Brown noise generates **sound randomly**, but unlike white noise, **energy decreases as frequency goes up** and *vice versa*\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Brown noise was given a name after Robert Brown who discovered *Brownian movement* (random)\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are **examples** of Brown noise",a:"- Rumble of strong winds\n- A rushing river\n- Pounding surf\n- Soft Rumbling thunder\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the **benefits** of Brown noise",a:"1. **Relaxation**\n2. As a **sleep-aid**\n3. Improved **concentration**\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is there something called **Black noise**",a:"Yes. **Absence of noise** is Black noise.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Just like absence of light is Black\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Ftypes_of_noises",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Ftypes_of_noises\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-06-17T05:10:40.736Z",updatedAt:"2022-06-17T06:32:12.947Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","flying_car","solid_state_battery","earth_day")));
