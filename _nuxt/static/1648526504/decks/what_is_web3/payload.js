Did we have a 1.0 and 2.0",a:"Yes. \n**Web 1.0** is termed for the first phase of internet when the protocols were defined and companies started putting up their web sites.\n&nbsp;\n**Web 2.0** is termed when folks started using the internet for social media apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc.\n",showQ:a},{q:"So what is new in Web 3.0",a:"It is an idea where the web content is based on:\n- **blockchain technology** (*separate deck available*) \n- with **decentralisation servers** \n- and **token-based economics**\n\nIt is characterised by users owning the content they create viz. blogs, posts, opinions etc.\n",showQ:a},{q:"So how is decentralised servers different from today's web servers",a:"Currently all the information is available on a single server (*or server farm*). All owned and controlled by the organisation who set up them up. In Web 3.0, the content will be **distributed on multiple servers** (as per the blockchain technology).\n",showQ:a},{q:"And what is the token-based economics mean",a:"That the creators of such a system could *offer their content* using crypto coins which users may have to furnish to *gain access* to information.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is wrong with Web 2.0 that needed a change",a:"Some of the ills of the current internet usage are:\n1.

Corporations and \u002F or Government set up the infrastructure required to run the internet servers\n2. They provide the service usually free or at minimal charges\n3. In return they capitalise the usage of their service by advertisements and\u002For influencing the users\n",showQ:a},{q:"How would the decentralised system protect privacy and ownership of content",a:"1. Blockchain distributed systems rely on encryption to prevent stealing of information\n2. This encryption also ensures no manipulation of someone else's data\n3.
