In Robotics\n2. In Prosthetics\n3. In Health Monitoring Technologies\n",showQ:a},{q:"How do e-skins help in Robotics",a:"It makes the robots more sensitive since it can now react to **senses** similar to humans\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Tests have shown that e-skins detect touch *faster* than human nervous system\n",showQ:a},{q:"How do e-skins help in Prosthetics",a:"People using prosthetic arms and other organs could now get a better sense of feel and touch which are so important and fundamental to *feeling normal*\n",showQ:a},{q:"How do e-skins help in health monitoring devices",a:"1. Wearable electronic devices with skin-like properties can provide continuous and real-time monitoring of human signals\n2.
