Another method is to use **radar** to identify moving objects remotely\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is the data collated to be later used to recognise the person",a:"**Machine learning** algorithms analyse the data. Broadly, the steps are\n1. **Capture gait data** via videos\n2. **Silhouette segmentation** is done by extraction from these videos\n3. **Contour detection** is the next step\n4. Finally, **feature extraction** is used to classify the person\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does this mean that gait recognition can be done only if the persons data has been captured",a:"Yes, similar to how a face recognition is done by comparing it to the faces in a database\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Though faces can be uploaded easily from photographs\n",showQ:a},{q:"How is gait recognition used in real life",a:"Usually with **surveillance cameras** in crowdy places for security purposes\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the advantages of gait recognition",a:"1. It is less **touchy-feely** than other biometric verification systems such as *retinal scans* or *fingerprints*\n2. It is **non-invasive** and can be applied without *user consent*\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why would it be better than facial recognition",a:"1. At times, it is difficult to capture the face of a person in a crowd from a distance\n2. It is easier for someone to change one's face\n3. It is a little difficult to camouflage one's gait\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the error rate of gait recognition technology",a:"Lab tests have show an error rate of only **0.7%**\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the disadvantages of gait recognition",a:"1. It requires **specialised equipment** like sensors and hi-res cameras to capture one's gait\n2.
