Bitcoin is one of them and the first to be introduced.",showQ:a},{q:"What do you mean by digital or virtual currency",a:"Unlike the paper or coin representation of value of money, think of a digital currency as a unique string of characters which holds some value\n",showQ:a},{q:"Besides being digital in what way is it different from any normal currency",a:"Traditional currencies are endorsed (and controlled) by the Central Bank of a country. Bitcoin has no such governing body.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does this mean no one owns Bitcoin",a:"Yes. Of sorts. There is no central bank, or banks who endorse a currency exchange between two parties like we have in conventional currency operations.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Who created Bitcoin",a:"A person by the name of **Satoshi Nakamoto**. No one knows who he is (or they are).  It is the name of a presumed pseudonymous person (or persons) who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation. \n",showQ:a},{q:"Can I send Bitcoin to another person",a:"Yes, you can send bitcoins to others just as well receive bitcoins from others\n",showQ:a},{q:"Similar to how I would send or receive in a digital wallet",a:"Yes, similar. \n&nbsp;\n\u003E With the difference being that the **wallet company** interacts with the banking system and deals with local currency.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What can I buy with Bitcoin",a:"Depends. Some e-commerce sites accept bitcoin as a mode of payment in which case goods or services can be purchased using it.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does the price of Bitcoin change over time",a:"Yes. It does based on market forces. Much like shares. Except that it is unregulated.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are there denominations in Bitcoin, like we have in normal currencies.",a:"No. But being a digital currency, you can part with a portion of it. \n&nbsp;\n\u003E A satoshi is the smallest denomination of bitcoin, equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin. \n",showQ:a},{q:"So how much is 1 satoshi",a:"One satoshi equals 0.00000001 bitcoins (*to its eighth decimal*)\n&nbsp;\n\u003E 100 million satoshis makes 1 bitcoin\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is there a transaction fee charged",a:"When any bitcoin transaction is done (send or receive) there is a transaction fee that is charged and net of that the amount is put in the wallet of the receiver\n",showQ:a},{q:"Where are all the transactions stored",a:"Bitcoin works on a Blockchain ledger system (*separate deck available*). The transactions are stored in the ledger across all servers of the Bitcoin network.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does this mean every transaction is on the ledger and know to one and all",a:"Yes. Except there is no way of linking a person to a particular bitcoin.",showQ:a},{q:"How secure is it from someone else stealing money from your bitcoin wallet",a:"Almost impossible. Think of it like a password. If someone has your password, then they can transfer the bitcoin to others.    \n",showQ:a},{q:"How can I buy a Bitcoin",a:"In an exchange similar to how you buy shares. Someone sells you a bitcoin (or part of) based on current market prices\n",showQ:a},{q:"Who maintain the servers of the Bitcoin network",a:"Folks who would like to **mine** bitcoins!\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is **Mining** in bitcoin terminology",a:"The servers that constitute the bitcoin distributed network **work hard** to maintain the system. For that they are rewarded by bitcoins (or part of). The process is called *Mining* and they are called **miners**.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can Bitcoin be infinitely generated or is it regulated in some form",a:"As per the original paper, it was decided to limit the total number of bitcoins to **21 million**\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why is there a limit set for number of bitcoins",a:"This is to emulate the concept similar to that of physical gold viz there is a finite quantity to be mined\n",showQ:a},{q:"And so far how many have been mined so far",a:"Around **19 million** bitcoins \n",showQ:a},{q:"How much more time will it take for the remainder 2 million to be mined",a:"By some estimates that will take place around 2040\n",showQ:a},{q:"Then, what happens after that",a:"No more bitcoins will be mined, of course. However, miners (*folks running the servers*) will continue to earn with transaction fee.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can cryptocoins be pegged to an existing currency",a:"Yes, it can. There are numerous cryptocoins that are pegged say to the US dollar. But Bitcoin is not one of them.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Do countries accept bitcoins as an official currency",a:"In 2021, **El Salvador** began accepting bitcoin as a currency alongwith US Dollar\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_bitcoin",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_bitcoin\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-01-24T03:27:46.971Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-08T06:24:46.702Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e},{dir:b,id:f}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","What is Bitcoin","what_are_cryptocoins","what_is_blockchain_ledger","what_is_nft")));
