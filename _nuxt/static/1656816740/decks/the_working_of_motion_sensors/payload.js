They detect and measure nearby motions.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the uses of motion sensors",a:"- **Security**: burglar alarms use it\n- **Power-saving**: auto switch on-off of electricity in a room\n- **Auto door-opening**: in high activity public buildings\n- **Driverless-cars**: to detect obstructions in traffic\n- **Health-care**: to monitor movements of elders (*and raise alarms*) who are more prone to accidents\n",showQ:a},{q:"When was motion detectors first used",a:"In **1940s** during World War II by **Samuel Bagno** who later developed the first  *burglar alarm* using that technology\n",showQ:a},{q:"Has the technology used for motion detection changed over time",a:"Yes. The first technology involved the use of **Ultrasonic** waves and the use of **Doppler effect**.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Ultrasonic waves are sound waves that the human ear cannot detect\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is **Doppler Effect**",a:"It is the phenomenon where there is an **increase** (*or decrease*) in the frequency of sound, light, or other waves as the source and observer move **towards** (*or away from*) each other\n&nbsp;\n\u003E example is the change in pitch when a siren passes through\n",showQ:a},{q:"What was the limitation of this technology in motion detection",a:"That it creates **false alarms** due to the disruption causes by innocent events like a *clock chime* or *wind*\n",showQ:a},{q:"What was the next technology adopted for motion detection",a:"In the 80s scientists began evaluating the **microwave** technology. A microwave motion sensor emits *waves* which are then reflected back to the receiver. The receiver **analyzes** the waves that are bounced back. If there is an object moving in the room, these waves are going to be **altered** which determines motion.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How do modern motion detectors work",a:"To remove the **false alarms** and improvise on detection they use a combination of technologies. And only if both indicate a movement, does it activate the next step (*alarm*).\n",showQ:a},{q:"What about LIDAR",a:"**LIDAR** (Light Detection and Ranging) gained importance because of its potential use in self-driven cars. It can detect the distance between two objects and is more accurate especially for detection of small objects and their movement.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E There is a separate deck on LIDAR\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it being popularly used",a:"Self-driven cars are the first use-case. The technology is still not cost effective.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is motion detection becoming more important as a tool",a:"Yes. Together with AI tools to analyse movement data and **make inferences**, it is gaining more prominence.\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fthe_working_of_motion_sensors",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fthe_working_of_motion_sensors\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-04-14T04:07:54.580Z",updatedAt:"2022-04-25T12:55:07.921Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","what_is_lidar","sensors_on_breeze","the_working_of_qrcodes")));
