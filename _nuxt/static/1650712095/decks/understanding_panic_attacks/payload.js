The symptoms appear and very soon there is a full fledged attack.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are panic attack episodes dangerous",a:"Despite how terrifying these episodes may be they are *not inherently* dangerous\n",showQ:a},{q:"How come they not dangerous when a person feels like *dying* during an episode",a:"Because the attacks are a manifestation of the mind and body being **out of sync**, not *necessarily* because of a physiological problem\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the causes of panic attacks",a:"1. Genetics\n2. Major Stress\n3. Temperament that is prone to negative emotions\n4. Changes in the way the brain functions\n",showQ:a},{q:"How long do panic attacks last",a:"Usually 10-15 minutes\n",showQ:a},{q:"What happens during the attack",a:"1. It starts with some stimulus from the environment: a *thought, sound or even smell*\n2. This triggers the *amygdala* in the brain to send a **distress** signal to the *hypothalamus*\n3. Hypothalamus fires messages to the different bodily functions to take defensive action\n4. This causes pupil dilation and increases breathing rate to take in more oxygen\n5. This results in some other parts of the body like the fingers and toes getting less oxygen\n",showQ:a},{q:"What can a person do when (s)he gets an attack",a:"If the person *recognises* it to be a panic attack (because they have had it in the past) then the best suggestion is to wait it out since they know that it **will pass**\n",showQ:a},{q:"How important is breathing in controlling an attack",a:"Very important and most effective. Normal breathing is *12-20 breaths* per minute. During an attack this **doubles**. So reducing it to **5 per minute** with *exhales longer than inhales* greatly helps.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the science behind why slow breathing helps",a:"This type of breathing stimulates the **vagus nerve** (the longest nerve in the body) which carries the signals and sensory information from and to the brain and regulates functions like heart rate and digestion\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is panic attack same as anxiety attack",a:"No. Panic attacks are sudden while anxiety attacks usually occur due to prolonged worry about something.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why have panic attacks increased in the world",a:"Doctors do not seem to have an exact answer. But many attribute this presumed increase in anxiety disorders to factors such as **social media**, **poor sleep habits**, **work-related stress** and **loneliness**.  \n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Funderstanding_panic_attacks",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Funderstanding_panic_attacks\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-04-14T11:23:59.280Z",updatedAt:"2022-04-14T13:03:03.631Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","covid_and_variants","what_is_sleep_apnea","nsdr_yoga_nidra")));
