The ability of the object to change shape over time.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Does this not mean that the material should have the property to change with stimulus",a:"Yes. And that is the key challenge of this technology. To find **smart materials** for all types of uses.\n",showQ:a},{q:"So what are such materials that can be used",a:"Either **Hydrogels** or **Shape Changing Polymers**\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are Hydrogels",a:"**Hydrogels** are polymer networks exhibit swelling\u002Fshrinking behavior when solvent molecules enter\u002Fleave the network\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are Shape Changing Polymers",a:"**Shape Changing Polymers** are smart materials that have the ability to return from a deformed state (*temporary shape*) to their original (*permanent*) shape when induced by an external stimulus (*trigger*), such as **temperature change**\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the advantages of 4D Printing",a:"Since the 4D printed objects can change shape, can shrink and unfold, objects that are too large to fit a printer can be compressed for 3D printing into their secondary form\n&nbsp;\n\u003E This is referred to as **computational folding**\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are some applications of 4D Printing",a:"1. **Healthcare**: Pills can activate only when body reaches a particular temperature\n2. **Self healing pipes**: that can heal themselves automatically if they crack or break, due to their ability to change in response to the environmentâ€™s change\n3. **Fashion**: Clothes become tighter in winter\n4. **Self Assembly Furniture**: A flat board will curl up into a chair by adding water or light\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is it possible for a common man to use 4D printing",a:"No. Not yet. It is still being researched.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which are some popular institutions working on it",a:"1. MIT's Self Assembly Lab\n2. Harvard's Institute of Biological Engineering\n3.
