It still requires folks with some logically ability to use the platforms. It would be right to say that with these platforms it does not require the programmer to know traditional languages of development\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are the two types of development the same",a:"Similar. Both ease development; with **no code** being the simpler of the two.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What language is used to develop apps using these platforms",a:"They use a more **visual approach** to software development with graphical interfaces to configure the elements of the app\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does this work",a:"The creators of these platforms break down traditional business processes into small independent modules that can be configured and put together\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is is the same as Rapid Application Development",a:"Its origins can be traced back to the 1990s where RADs became fashionable\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why has it suddenly gained prominence",a:"With the power of cloud computing and the maturity of modular development, the time seemed ripe for such development platforms to be available. To add to this was the tremendous surge in number of developers required since technology started affecting almost every aspect of our lives.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Besides faster development, what are the advantages of low-code development",a:"1. Rapid Development\n2. Build maintainable solutions\n3. Integrating best practices of business processes\n4. End-users could not get involved in the development process\n5. Development can easily happen in parallel and in phases\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are low-code solutions available for all business functions",a:"Most. And it is improving every day as more of such platforms are gaining popularity.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are some popular low-code applications being developed",a:"1. Web-based customer portals\n2. B2C (business-to-consumer) mobile apps\n3. SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) products are now available on no-code platforms\n4. Apps that need to capture data that can be processed on spreadsheets are worthy candidates\n",showQ:a},{q:"Who started the no-code revolution",a:"Like with many development in technology, small bits of changes are continuously taking place. Some of the ones that lead to the current state of low-code development are:\n1. Growth of **Wordpress** for websites\n2. Sites like **Webflow** that gave greater creative freedom\n3. UI component tools like **Figma** that now integrates with a plethora of development tools\n4. **Appsheet** that helps make an app with a few clicks\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is low-code development growing or is it a passing fad",a:"Industry pundits predict that by 2024 it will account for about 65% of all development and in 2021 grew at 44%\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the criticisms of use low-code development",a:"1. Complicated systems would not be able to use low-code development tools\n2. Many IT departments fear that it will create a number of **Shadow IT** apps that they will not be able to support\n3. Some fear that the rigor of testing done in conventional apps is never followed with low-code development. Consequently, it is of poor quality and has bugs and errors. \n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Flow_code_no_code",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Flow_code_no_code\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-03-04T09:13:24.480Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-07T09:21:15.738Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","what_is_web3","quantum_computers","what_is_blockchain_ledger")));
