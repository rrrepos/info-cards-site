In a conventional solar panel, energy from the sunlight is absorbed by the **Photo Voltaic** (PV) cells in the panel. This energy creates **electrical charges**.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Then, how does this absorption happen in a transparent panel",a:"The special cells **selectively harnesses** a portion of the *solar spectrum* that is invisible to the naked eye, while allowing the normal visible light to pass through\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are these special cells made of",a:"Researchers have developed a transparent luminescent solar concentrator (**TLSC**) which is composed of organic salts that are designed to absorb specific invisible UV and infrared light wavelengths\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does TLSC convert these into electricity",a:"After absorption they **glow as another invisible wavelength** which is guided to the edge of the window plastic, where **thin PV solar cell strips** convert them into electricity.",showQ:a},{q:"What is the efficiency of this conversion",a:"Of about **10%** as per lab tests\n&nbsp;\n\u003E normal solar panels deliver about 20% efficiency\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is not 10% a low conversion",a:"Given that with this technology *normal windows can be replaced* by transparent solar panels with no loss of light, it can be a useful technology\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are partial solar windows being made too",a:"Yes. Both **fully** and **partially transparent** solar panels are being made. The partially transparents solar windows serve particularly well for windows of buildings that, in the normal course, use *tinted glass* to reduce transmitted light.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are other uses of this technology",a:"**Solar blinds** are another use where in the conventional blinds that are used to block sunlight and save energy can be replaced by these blinds so that at the same time they produce electricity\n",showQ:a},{q:"Are transparent solar panels available commercially",a:"There are buildings that have been using these panels in parts and experimenting with their performance and efficiency\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the challenges these panels pose today",a:"1.
