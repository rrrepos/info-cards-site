Tubes are laid out between pod terminals\n2. The air within the tube is sucked out to provide a frictionless movement of the pods\n3. The pods accelerate using electric propulsion\n4. The pods floats in the tube using magnetic levitation and guides\n",showQ:a},{q:"How many passengers can travel in a pod",a:"Depends on the pod. Current tests have shown seating capacity of 20 to 40 passengers",showQ:a},{q:"Do passengers feel uncomfortable during travel",a:"Not as per test reports. Passengers feel *stronger than* when one takes off in a plane but not discomforting as reported.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the advantages of Hyperloop technology",a:"1. Transportation will be faster\n2. It is supposed to be built quicker and cheaper than rail infrastructure\n",showQ:a},{q:"Is Hyperloop tunnel always built below the ground",a:"No. The technology is independent of below or over land. However, at times it may be easier to bore a tunnel below land to overcome challenges of creating a path.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the diameter of the tunnel",a:"In some of the proof of concept runs, the tunnels have been between 3 and 4 metres",showQ:a},{q:"Which are the companies developing Hyperloop travel infrastructure",a:"1. The Boring Company\n2. Virgin Hyperloop\n3. Hyperloop Transportation\n4. Transpod\n",showQ:a},{q:"Has any company started Hyperloop operations",a:"No. It has not yet been commercially launched.\n",showQ:a},{q:"Has any test being conducted with passengers",a:"Yes. Virgin Hyperloop were the first to conduct a test with human passengers.\n- on 8-Nov-2020\n- on a 500m track in Nevada, US\n- took 15 seconds\n- reached speed of 172 km\u002Fh or 107 mph\n- passengers\n  - Lara Luchian and Josh Giegel \n  - Tanay Manjrekar and Anne Huynh\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which are some of the Hyperloop projects underway",a:"1. 2km *proof of concept* in **Hawthorne** in Los Angeles county, US\n2. 48 kms between cities **Mumbai and Pune** of India\n3. 690 km between **Dallas and Laredo** in Texas, US\n4. 951 km between **Jeddah and Riyadh** in Saudi Arabia\n",showQ:a},{q:"Who conceived of the Hyperloop",a:"There has been some mention of a similar technology by an inventor named **George Medhurst** in 1799\n",showQ:a},{q:"Why is Elon Musk being credited with the Hyperloop",a:"Because, Elon Musk reignited interest with his *Hyperloop Alpha* paper in August 2013, which set out how a modern system would work and how much it would cost\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_hyperloop",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fwhat_is_hyperloop\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-02-08T12:16:29.443Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-24T12:39:57.351Z"},related:[],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"What is Hyperloop")));
