They have the potential to be faster and more powerful than classical computers.\n",showQ:a},{q:"How much faster can they potentially process",a:"It is said that such computers could process about 1 trillion chess moves per second!\n",showQ:a},{q:"Cannot classical computers reach that computing power",a:"No. \n&nbsp;\nThere is a fundamental manner in which instructions are processed in a normal computer and while it will improve over time, there is a limit. Quantum computing uses a totally different computing method which makes it potentially very powerful.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the problems that  only Quantum computing can solve",a:"These are complex mathematical problems. For example:\n1. What are the Prime factors of a number\n2. Asking questions like: is some mathematical phenomenon true **for all** values \n3. Solving the **Tail Assignment Problem** : assigning airplanes to flights with the goal of minimizing connection times between flights subject to maintenance constraints\n",showQ:a},{q:"Cannot some of the problems be solved using Statistical algorithms in classical computers",a:"To a certain extent, yes. \n&nbsp;\nModern computers have greatly enhanced their power to handle complex algorithms. And even if they can solve it using conventional computing, doing so on a quantum computer will be easier and quicker.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are **cubits** in quantum processing",a:"Quantum bits, which are used for quantum computing which can hold multiple values\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is a Quantum Turing Machine",a:"1. It is an is an abstract machine to model the effects of a quantum computer\n2.
