An eye takes in *light* through the **pupil**\n2. The lens, then, *focuses that light* onto the back of the eye, where there is a thick layer of light sensitive tissue called the **retina**\n3. Cells called **photoreceptors** turn the light into *electrical signals* \n4. These signals travel down the **optic nerve** to the brain\n5. The brain, then, interprets *interprets the images*. \n",showQ:a},{q:"Which type of sight problems can the bionic eye solve",a:"People with vision loss like partial or color loss caused by genetics, illness or injury\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can people see like others using bionic eyes",a:"No. While it cannot restore vision it helps people who are completely blind perceive light and reflections of light.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What, then, is the use of bionic eyes",a:"Even though these artificial eyes cannot restore complete vision, it allows folks with impaired vision to become **more mobile and independent**, and return to them some of the *quality of life* they lost or did not have\n",showQ:a},{q:"Can people who have never had eyesight benefit from bionic eyes",a:"No. Most of the bionic eye technologies being developed require a **healthy optic nerve** and a **developed visual cortex**.\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Patients need to *have been able to see in the past* for these devices to work successfully\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does the Bionic eye work",a:"It consists of a **camera**, attached to a pair of glasses, which transmits *radio signals* to a **microchip implanted in the retina**. The implanted chip convert these signals into electrical impulses to stimulate cells in the retina that connect to the optic nerve.\n",showQ:a},{q:"When did the research for bionic eye begin",a:"Like most scientific inventions that takes years to develop and improve, the first retinal prosthesis began in 2002\n&nbsp;\n\u003E **Prosthesis**: is a artificial body part\n",showQ:a},{q:"When was the first bionic eye transplant done",a:"In 2009, 3 patients were fitted with bionic eyes as part of a trial by the surgeons at Manchester and Moorfields hospital, in the U.K\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Keith Hayman was the first to receive a bionic eye\n",showQ:a},{q:"What is the current state of bionic eyes",a:"Researchers are using an advanced computer model to mimic the human retina, in order to improve prosthetic eye technology\n&nbsp;\n\u003E Research to improvise the state of the prosthesis is taking place in Australia, UK, Germany, France and US\n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fbionic_eyes",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fbionic_eyes\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-03-13T10:38:26.394Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-24T12:13:32.339Z"},related:[],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true)));
