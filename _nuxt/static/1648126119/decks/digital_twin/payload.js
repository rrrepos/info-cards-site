No. Learn more by flipping through this deck",category:"Technology",level:"General",author:"rmr",listable:a,related:[{id:c},{id:d},{id:e}],cards:[{q:"What do we mean by Digital Twin\"",a:"It is a **virtual model** designed to accurately reflect a physical object, process or service",showQ:a},{q:"Is it like a *simulation* of sorts",a:"Yes. A **digital twin** is a computer program that uses real world data to create simulations that can predict how a product or process will perform\n",showQ:a},{q:"How does it work",a:"Internet of Things (IoTs) gather data from the physical world via sensors and send it to the digital twin program to reconstruct\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the uses of building a digital twin",a:"1. The feedback from the simulations are used to improve the product or service being tested\n2. By integrating with IoT and Artificial Intelligence it spurs innovation\n3. It identifies faults in systems and prevents their failures\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are examples of Digital Twins",a:"1. In **Healthcare** a digital twin of a patient or organs allows surgeons to practice procedures in a simulated environment rather than on a real patient\n2. In **Formula 1 cars** the team can study the behaviour of the car in adverse road conditions\n3. In **Smart cities**, town planners uses digital twin technology to understand and improve the life for its citizens (e.g. *Singapore**).\n",showQ:a},{q:"When is a digital twin used",a:"1. Before a product is created\n2. After it is created to run tests and simulations\n3. To test capabilities and run prognostics\n",showQ:a},{q:"Which industries popularly use digital twins",a:"- automotive\n- healthcare\n- disaster management\n- retail\n- power\n",showQ:a},{q:"Who introduced the concept of digital twins",a:"1. The concept of digital twins was first put forward by David Gelernterâ€™s 1991 book *Mirror Worlds,*. \n2. However,  **Michael Grieves** is credited with applying the concept to manufacturing in 2002.\n3. But it was John Vickers of NASA who introduced the term in 2010.\n",showQ:a},{q:"When was the concept of digital twins first used",a:"NASA first used the idea to improve the physical model simulation of spacecraft in 2010\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the important components of a digital twin",a:"**Data** and **Modeling**\n&nbsp;\n- Data about the product, its lifecycle, design, material parts etc\n- Analytical models that use the data to understand its effect on fatigue, failure and stress\n",showQ:a},{q:"What are the benefits of digital twins",a:"1. Save costs by reducing maintenance\n2. Reduce accidents\n3. Reduce downtime\n",showQ:a},{q:"Do human digital twins exist",a:"Yes. It aims to create Digital Twins that reproduce not only the *outer aspects* of a human being, such as physical and physiological characteristics, but also **inner qualities** such as *personality*, *sensibilities*, *thoughts* and *skills*.\n",showQ:a},{q:"What could be the uses of a human digital twin",a:"1. Use a digital twin as an interface\n2. Create a personal agent to work on ones behalf\n3. By merging capabilities of twins, one could potentially build a twin that has the best of each individual twin \n",showQ:a}],dir:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fdigital_twin",path:"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002Fdigital_twin\u002Fcontent",extension:".yaml",createdAt:"2022-02-28T05:05:41.457Z",updatedAt:"2022-03-24T12:15:54.819Z"},related:[{dir:b,id:c},{dir:b,id:d},{dir:b,id:e}],links:[]}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}(true,"\u002Fdecks\u002Fen\u002F","what_is_metaverse","what_is_nft","iot")));
