Artworks\n2. Music\n3. Videos\n4. Memorabilia\n5. Collectibles\n6. Tweets\n7. Alcohol (Yes!)\n8. Digital Sneakers (really?)\n9. Source code (programs)\n10. Virtual real estate\n\nAlmost anything.\n"},{q:"How can NFTs be for physical items?",a:"Remember an NFT is a **representation** for something. Neither a digital artwork nor a physical item is part of the NFT"},{q:"Does the NFT contain the digital item or asset?",a:"No. Again the NFT is a representation of the item, whether it is physical or digital"},{q:"What do we mean by representation of an item",a:"Think of how a library card in a physical Library which is a representation of the physical book that is stored in the shelf."},{q:"Does that mean that the asset, digital or physical is stored elsewhere",a:"Yes.\n\nAt times it may be just a notional ownership not even having access to the underlying asset.\n"},{q:"Does the owner of an NFT get copyrights to the underlying asset",a:"Usually not.\n\nAgain just like in the physical world, purchasing a book does not give you copyright to its content or purchasing an artwork does not give you its rights.\n"},{q:"Does this mean that an artwork (digital or otherwise) can be owned by several people",a:"Yes.

Right?",a:"Yes, the terms of the NFT are specified and part of the NFT."},{q:"Why would someone buy an NFT",a:"Because it is of some value to them and in most cases it's value, they believe, would appreciate over time. Just like any other asset."},{q:"Why would a creator sell an NFT",a:"It is another media to sell something one has created."},{q:"Why would someone sell an item as a NFT instead of using shops or auction houses or brokers",a:"To cut the middle-man\n\nNFTs are sold using a blocked chain network (explained in another deck) and it facilitates a direct buy-sell between two parties.\n"},{q:"Do physical goods bought get sent to the buyer",a:"Yes, in most cases. As mentioned the terms of purchase are part of the NFT buying process."},{q:"Does owning a NFT give the buyer exclusive access to the asset",a:"Not necessary.\n\nSomeone who has an NFT for, say, a digital painting does not mean that the rest of the world cannot see that painting. The artist may choose to display the painting on her\u002Fhis website thereby giving access to one and all to view the painting.\n"},{q:"Which was the first NFT that was sold by a major auction house",a:"A digital artwork called **Everydays: The First 5000 Days** by Beeple.\n\n1.
