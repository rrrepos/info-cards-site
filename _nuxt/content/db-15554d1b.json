types of vegetables are popularly grown using Hydroponics","a":"1. Lettuce and other greens, like spinach and kale\n2. Tomatoes\n3. Cucumbers\n4. Green Beans\n5. Basil\n"},{"q":"In what way is growing using Hydroponics better than using soil","a":"Plants grown hydroponically grow significantly faster than soil-grown plants\n&nbsp;\n> since the plant's roots have easy access to nutrients, so they can easily be absorbed\n"},{"q":"Do hydroponic plants taste differently","a":"Yes. But then even plants grown on different soils taste different!\n"},{"q":"What are the nutrients required for these plants","a":"All plants basically need the same 5 key nutrients: \n- nitrogen\n- phosphorous\n- potassium\n- calcium\n- magnesium\n&nbsp;\n> some plants may require more of one nutrient than another\n"},{"q":"Can regular fertilisers be used for hydroponic plants","a":"Yes, but not recommended. Special nutrients are available that ensure the right concentration required for growth.\n"},{"q":"Is sunlight required for hydroponic plants","a":"**Light** is required for hydroponics, but *not necessarily* sunlight\n&nbsp;\n> they can be grown outdoors or in a greenhouse or even in indoor space with sufficient natural light\n"},{"q":"Are hydroponic sprouts more nutritious than its soil equivalents","a":"Hydroponically grown sprouts are healthier since they draw from wholesome nutrient water solutions\n&nbsp;\n> Sprouts even when consumed in smaller quantities can give you sufficient nutrition\n"},{"q":"In general are hydroponically grown vegetables more nutritious than soil grown vegetables","a":"Hydroponics gives the growers the ability to **control** the nutrients. Hence, it would be right to say that the vegetables that grow from this process would be more nutritious ... unless less care has been taken!\n"},{"q":"Is it true that hydroponically grown tomatoes are tasteless","a":"The method usually produces tomatoes that are big and juicy tomatoes viz. has more water and cellulose, and less flavor per bite\n"},{"q":"Are there plants that cannot be grown hydroponically","a":"Yes. Mostly root plants which require plenty of soils to spread their roots in search of moisture and nutrients. Such as:\n- turnips\n- onions\n- garlic\n- carrots\n"},{"q":"Are hydroponic systems like fish tanks that need to replinish their water periodically","a":"Yes. Depending on the size, water and nutrients are re-calibrated to ensure that the right level of nutrients exist in the water. This is done every two or three weeks\n"},{"q":"So, what are the advantages of Hydroponics","a":"1. Better control of nutrients and hence more efficient\n2. Plants can be grown outside of fields viz. at homes too\n3.

The sensor uses the **time** it took for each pulse to return to the sensor to calculate the distance it traveled\n"},{"q":"What is a Laser","a":"A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification\n&nbsp; \n> **LASER**: is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation\"\n"},{"q":"Is LIDAR similar to RADAR","a":"Yes, in the sense that they do similar tasks but work in different ways because they do not use the same wavelength type\n&nbsp;\n> **RADAR** is Radio Detection and Ranging\n"},{"q":"What about SONAR, is LIDAR similar to it","a":"Again, SONAR too has the same objective of measuring distance but uses a different medium viz sound waves\n&nbsp;\n> **SONAR** is Sound Navigation and Ranging\n"},{"q":"Is Lidar better than Radar and Sonar","a":"LiDAR uses lasers with a much lower wavelength than the radio waves used by RADAR. Thanks to this, LiDAR has better accuracy and precision, which allows it to detect smaller objects and create 3D models.\n"},{"q":"How is the 3D model creation helpful","a":"It can be used to now predict whether the object is, say, a **tree**, **person** or a **wall** \n"},{"q":"Why has Lidar become popular","a":"Because it is an important component of self-driving cars\n"},{"q":"How is Lidar used in cars","a":"Autonomous cars usually have a unit on its roof that houses the Lidar unit. It continuously emits pulses to determine all the objects relative to the position of the car in 3D.\n"},{"q":"How **small** an object can a Lidar placed on a car see","a":"Tests have shown that they can detect even the hand signal given by a cyclist!\n"},{"q":"Can Lidar *see through* walls","a":"No. The pulses emitted by the laser will bounce off the wall \n"},{"q":"Which are some of the other applications where Lidar is being used","a":"1. **Agriculture**: It can reveal topography including fields, slopes, farmland etc\n2. **Mining**: To evaluate periodic scans of ore removal\n3. **Surveying**: Flights fitted with Lidars can quickly scan vast areas \n"},{"q":"What are the disadvantages of using Lidar","a":"1. Its high cost\n2.

It is a wireless communication that aims to use light to transmit information from point A to point B\n"},{"q":"How does it work","a":"The technology works by encoding digital data and turning LED bulbs on and off faster than humans can notice to transfer it. The light then travels to a photoreceptor, which can decode and translate the data to a more classic radio frequency (WiFi, or 4G or 5G).\n"},{"q":"Is the transmission of data faster","a":"Yes, its theroretical speeds are aboput 100Gbit/s, more than 5 times faster than WiFi (5G)\n"},{"q":"How is WiFi wireless different from LiFi wireless","a":"WiFi uses radio frequencies while LiFi uses visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light frequencies\n"},{"q":"In what way is it different from WiFi","a":"1. LiFi is based on light frequency while WiFi is based on radio frequency\n2. The light source and receptor should be in close proximity unlike WiFi, which can pass through walls\n3. LiFi range is much more limited than WiFi\n4. Chances of interference is more in LiFi over WiFi\n"},{"q":"Since LiFi can connect devices within the same room is it not limiting","a":"Yes. But the silver lining is that people cannot stealthily piggy back on a connection\n"},{"q":"Is it similar to Fibre Optics","a":"Yes, in the sense that the fibre optic cables uses light to transmit data. But LiFi is a wireless communication.\n"},{"q":"Are there applications where it would be better suited over WiFi","a":"Yes, in **electromagnetic sensitive areas** such as in aircraft cabins, hospitals and nuclear power plants where data transfer can be done without causing electromagnetic interference\n"},{"q":"One hears of **spectrum crisis** in the context of Wireless data. Will that change with LiFi","a":"Yes. WiFi uses radio frequencies which are close to full capacity, LiFi on the other hand uses visible light frequencies which are 10,000 times larger than radio waves \n"},{"q":"Who coined the word LiFi","a":"Harald Haas coined during a TED talk in 2011\n"},{"q":"Is it commercically being used","a":"Not yet.

Play games on a virtual playground or arena\n2. Learn in a virtual classroom\n3. Train to operate virtual machines\n4. Just hang around in an area and socialise with people\n5. Buy property!\n"},{"q":"Who coined the word","a":"It was first described in the 1992 novel **Snow Crash** by Neal Stephenson\n"},{"q":"When did it all start","a":"Technology is usually built bit by bit and Metaverse is no different. Virtual online communities were built in the early 2000s. *Second Life* in 2003 being one of the most popular.\n"},{"q":"Why is Metaverse getting popular now","a":"Time is ripe due to progress in:\n- 5G networks\n- more computing power and memory in small devices\n- coming of age of and VR and AR\n- need to work remotely\n"},{"q":"Do we need special equipment to participate in Metaverse","a":"1. A desktop or notebook computer\n2. A Virtual Reality (VR) headset for an immersive experience\n3. Tactile Gloves will help feel objects in this  world\n4. Wrist sensors to feel sensation (e.g. *Bow & Arrow games*) \n5. Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses to interact with objects\n"},{"q":"Do I need to walk at home to move in the virtual world","a":"No! That would be disastrous. There are a number of ways this is accomplished\n1. Using the keyboard one can move in two directions\n2. People wear a harness around them and walk like in a treadmill\n3. In some cases, you may just point to a place and you get *teleported* there\n"},{"q":"How would we use the keyboard to move","a":"For example:\n1. Moving the up and down arrow takes you forward or backward\n2. Similarly the left and right arrow moves you left or right\n3. Perhaps, a shift + left will turn your view to the left\n\nWhile keyboard equivalents are available, having a VR headset makes the experience immersive. \n"},{"q":"How do we focus or point to an object","a":"Just like we have a cursor on a normal computer, so is the case in a Metaverse world. \n1. The cursor can be pointed to an object and clicked to select via a mouse.\n2. Or if one uses a headset, then we turn in the desired direction and position the cursor on that object and tap on a button on the side of the headset. \n"},{"q":"Can we move objects in Metaverse","a":"Yes, this is much like in the physical world, where using the hand gloves, you could touch objects, move them, lift them and place them elsewhere\n"},{"q":"What are **Hand Gloves**","a":"These are electronic gloves with controllers that are connected to the headset so that movement of one's hands get translated to gestures in the virtual world  \n"},{"q":"Is it similar to the purpose of joy sticks in gaming","a":"Yes. These versatile hand controllers can be used in 3D environments."},{"q":"Can we speak to others in Metaverse","a":"Yes. You would need a mic and a speaker to talk and listen to others, similar to how we use them in a video conferencing session.\n&nbsp;\nMany of the VR headsets have inbuilt speakers and mics attached.\n"},{"q":"Then, how is it different from video conferencing","a":"It is 3D and the experience gives you a feeling of being in the other place\n"},{"q":"Can we see the other person like we do in a video","a":"No. Everyone is represented by an **avatar**. Though many create avatars which have a resemblance to their own self.\n"},{"q":"How are avatars created similar to oneself","a":"Avatar creation softwares are available that take a bunch of snaps from different positions or using a camera to create an avatar. These avatars have a fair resemblance to the person. Once made, it can be kept as an indentity for all worlds.\n"},{"q":"Would not people make avatars that are different from how they look","a":"Yes. And very often that is the case. In fact, one of the likely reasons for its popularity is that a person can be a very **different** one in this virtual world. \n"},{"q":"Why are people buying space in Metaverse worlds","a":"All real estate investments are for two purposes:\n1. To stay or enjoy the property\n2. As investment to sell it when it appreciates      \n\nIn the case of Metaverse, it is often the latter.\n"},{"q":"Is VR experiences similar to the **Real Player One** movie","a":"Yes. The movie which was based on the book by *Ernest Cline* explored how people escape the problems of earth by going into a virtual world ... except a movie is a

The artist may choose to display the painting on her/his website.\n"},{"q":"Would this not diminish the value of the asset","a":"No. \n&nbsp;  \nTake the case of the famed *Mona Lisa* painting.

None of this diminishes the value of the original artwork.\n"},{"q":"Which was the first NFT that was sold by a major auction house","a":"A digital artwork called **Everydays: The First 5000 Days** by Beeple.\n\n1.

You can't get enough air, thereby lowering the oxygen level in your blood. Your brain senses your inability to breathe and briefly rouses you from sleep so that you can reopen your airway.\n"},{"q":"Does this cause one to choke or gasp for breath","a":"Yes.

A CPAP machine generates a continuous stream of pressurized air that travels through a mask that’s sealed around your nose or mouth delivering purified air.\n2. As you sleep, the airstream now pushes against any blockages, opening your airways so your lungs receive plenty of oxygen.\n3. Without anything obstructing this flow of oxygen, your breathing doesn’t pause giving you a restful night.\n"},{"q":"Is there a similar machine called BiPAP","a":"Yes, it refers to **Bilevel or two-level Positive Airway Pressure**. While CPAP generally delivers a *single pressure*, BiPAP delivers two: an **inhale** pressure and an **exhale** pressure.\n"}],"dir":"/decks/en/what_is_sleep_apnea","path":"/decks/en/what_is_sleep_apnea/content","extension":".yaml","createdAt":"2022-03-11T11:23:25.354Z","updatedAt":"2022-03-16T07:57:20.621Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1647602689825},"$loki":55},{"slug":"content","id":"what_is_vr","title":"What is Virtual Reality","description":"A non-technical understanding of VR","category":"Technology","level":"General","author":"rmr","listable":true,"related":[{"id":"what_is_ar"},{"id":"what_is_metaverse"},{"id":"what_is_blockchain_ledger"}],"cards":[{"q":"What is the full form of VR","a":"Virtual Reality"},{"q":"What does VR do","a":"VR is the use of computer technology to **simulate a 3D environment**"},{"q":"What are some of the examples of VR","a":"1.

a VR headset require a mobile","a":"The simpler VR headsets require a mobile to utilise the capabilities of the mobile for **connectivity**, **mic**, **speaker** and **sensors**. \n&nbsp;\nHowever, standalone VR headsets are available which have all these capabilties in-built.\n"},{"q":"Which sensors are required for a VR experience","a":"Either from within the headset or via the smartphone, VRs use some combination of:\n- accelerometer \n- gyroscope \n- magnetometer\n- proximity sensor \n\nall to detect the user's motion in the virtual world.\n"},{"q":"What is an Accelerometer","a":"It is a tool that measures acceleration of the body as the user moves across the virtual world"},{"q":"What is a Gyroscope","a":"It is a tool to sense angular rotational velocity and acceleration of the body as the user turns"},{"q":"What is a Magnetometer","a":"It is a tool to detect the relative orientation of your mobile / VR relative to the Earth's magnetic north"},{"q":"Do we see other folks in the virtual world","a":"Yes. But as **avatars**.\n"},{"q":"What are avatars","a":"In VR terms, an avatar is a **3D graphical representation** of a user or the user's character or *persona*"},{"q":"Can we turn using VR","a":"Yes. It provides a 360 degree view of the virtual world. So turning and moving your head will change the view in all directions.\n"},{"q":"Can we move in the virtual world using VR headset","a":"Yes. When viewing through the headset there is a cursor (*much like the cursor of our computer*). Often, placing the cursor ahead and **tapping a button** on the side of the headset *transports* you there.\n"},{"q":"Can we speak to others in the virtual world","a":"It depends on how the virtual environment has been prepared; if they enable talking to others in the virtual room, then the **mic** and **speaker** (of the VR or mobile) will be used for communication"},{"q":"Who prepares a virtual world","a":"1. The Virtual world is prepared via a software running on some servers\n2. The Virtual elements like roads, building, walls, seats etc are needed to be created using computer graphics\n3. When we connect to that world (*like visiting a website*) one can move around and explore the world\n"},{"q":"Which companies make VR headsets","a":"Some of the popular names are:\n1. Oculus Rift\n2. Sony Playstation VR\n3. HTC Vive\n4. Samsung Gear\n"}],"dir":"/decks/en/what_is_vr","path":"/decks/en/what_is_vr/content","extension":".yaml","createdAt":"2022-02-04T07:10:10.988Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-09T05:58:00.013Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1647602689826},"$loki":56},{"slug":"content","id":"what_is_web3","title":"What is Web 3.0","description":"A simple understanding of Web 3.0","category":"Technology","level":"General","author":"rmr","listable":true,"related":[{"id":"what_is_blockchain_ledger"},{"id":"what_is_metaverse"},{"id":"what_is_bitcoin"}],"cards":[{"q":"Web 3.0 &#128563;?

All owned and controlled by the organisation who set up them up. In Web 3.0, the content will be **distributed on multiple servers** (as per the blockchain technology).\n"},{"q":"And what is the token-based economics mean","a":"That the creators of such a system could *offer their content* using crypto coins which users may have to furnish to *gain access* to information.\n"},{"q":"What is wrong with Web 2.0 that needed a change","a":"Some of the ills of the current internet usage are:\n1. Thanks to the popularity of social media, big-tech internet companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter have become powerful and have the ability to influence and control people.\n2.
