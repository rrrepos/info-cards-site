Now, these prefab components can be made using 3D printers.\n2. **Car components**: Auto ancilliaries are being made esp with new materials being used in 3D printing\n3. **Jewellery**: Intricate designs can now be made via a computer\n"}],"dir":"/decks/en/what_is_3d_printing","path":"/decks/en/what_is_3d_printing/content","extension":".yaml","createdAt":"2022-02-08T05:39:45.164Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-08T06:40:08.834Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1644326601794},"$loki":8},{"slug":"content","id":"what_is_ar","title":"What is Augmented Reality","description":"A non-technical understanding of AR","category":"Technical","level":"General","author":"rmr","listable":true,"related":[{"id":"what_is_vr"},{"id":"what_is_metaverse"}],"cards":[{"q":"What is the full form of AR","a":"Augmented Reality"},{"q":"What happens in AR","a":"Simply put, when you point the camera of your mobile to an object, *say a flower*, details of the flower may appear as an overlay on the screen. This is via AR technology.\n"},{"q":"So it enhances real-world experiences in a way, right?","a":"Yes. In short it allows you to interact with that object the camera focuses on. These include:\n1. Giving information on the screen\n2. Playing a video or audio related to that object\n3. Or simply offering a menu from which to choose one or many options\n"},{"q":"How does it work","a":"1. The system captures the image to where the camera is pointed\n2. Shares it with a software running either on the device or an internet server\n3. An AI algorithm recognises (a best estimate) the object.\n4. Offers or puts out information about that object available to the software\n"},{"q":"What are the uses of AR","a":"1. Classroom Education\n2. Medical Training\n3. Repair and Maintenance of equipment\n4. Retailing when browsing articles\n5. Tourism\n"},{"q":"Is this not similar to QR codes","a":"Yes, in the sense that an image is used to identify the product. Except that in a QR code system, someone will have to create a code for every object and place it near the object to be scanned. In the case of AR, you simple scan the object.\n"},{"q":"What are AR glasses","a":"These are spectacles that serve the same function that the camera of a mobile does. Wearing it, the user can focus on an object, and visible on the lens of the glasses will be information about it."},{"q":"Where does the AR system get this information form","a":"The AR system has a software running that gives it its ability. \n&nbsp;\nFor example, a *classroom AR based system*, will send the image or the identified object to a server on the internet which retrieves the required information. Just like any other app.\n"},{"q":"How is AR different from VR (Virtual Reality)","a":"The two are complementing technologies. (There is a separate deck on VR).\n&nbsp;\nAR enhances real world objects with additonal digital information while VR takes you to an interactive and immersive virtual world.\n"},{"q":"Can AR and VR co-exist","a":"Yes. In a VR based virtual world, one can *point* at objects which will bring in additional information about that object.\n"},{"q":"Has AR become popular","a":"Like any new technology, it is being slowly adopted. \n&nbsp;\nOne of the most popular apps is to check how furniture (app provided by a furniture store) can be placed within the room of your home before making a decision to purchase\n"},{"q":"How does such an app work","a":"1. Imagine that you have picked an item, *say a sofa*, from the digital store front.\n2. Then, point the AR app to a part of the room where you would like to place it.\n3. The app has the ability to measure distances and the space available.\n4. Then, as you place the sofa at the desired place, it can estimate whether it fits or not.\n5. Further, as a consumer, you can check the suitability of the item in the room and try out various uphosteries.\n"}],"dir":"/decks/en/what_is_ar","path":"/decks/en/what_is_ar/content","extension":".yaml","createdAt":"2022-02-04T07:12:03.932Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-08T04:15:56.636Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1644326601795},"$loki":9},{"slug":"content","id":"what_is_bitcoin","title":"What is Bitcoin","description":"A non-technical understanding of Bitcoin","category":"Technical","level":"General","author":"rmr","listable":true,"related":[{"id":"what_is_nft"},{"id":"what_is_blockchain_ledger"}],"cards":[{"q":"What is Bitcoin","a":"It is a type of cryptocurrency"},{"q":"What is a Cryptocurrency","a":"A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. \n&nbsp;\n> A separate deck is dedicated towards cryptocurrency\n"},{"q":"Is Bitcoin the only cryptocurrency","a":"No. There are hundreds of crytocurrency called **crytocoins**.

Bitcoin has no such governing body.\n"},{"q":"Does this mean no one owns Bitcoin","a":"Yes. Of sorts. There is no central bank, or banks who endorse a currency exchange between two parties like we have in conventional currency operations.\n"},{"q":"Who created Bitcoin","a":"A person by the name of **Satoshi Nakamoto**. No one knows who he is or they are.  It is the name of a presumed pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation. \n"},{"q":"Can I send Bitcoin to another person","a":"Yes, you can send bitcoins to others just as well receive bitcoins from others\n"},{"q":"Similar to how I would send or receive in a digital wallet","a":"Yes, similar. With the difference being that the **wallet company** interacts with the banking system and deals with local currency.\n"},{"q":"What can I buy with Bitcoin","a":"Depends. Some e-commerce sites accept bitcoin as a mode of payment in which case goods or services can be purchased using it.\n"},{"q":"Does the price of Bitcoin change over time","a":"Yes. It does based on market forces. Much like shares. Except that it is unregulated.\n"},{"q":"Are there denominations in Bitcoin, like we have in normal currencies.","a":"No. Since it is a digital currency, you can part with a portion of it. A satoshi is the smallest denomination of bitcoin, equivalent to 100 millionth of a bitcoin. \n"},{"q":"So how much is 1 satoshi","a":"One satoshi equals 0.00000001 bitcoins"},{"q":"Is there a transaction fee charged","a":"When any bitcoin transaction is done (send or receive) there is a transaction fee that is charged and net of that the amount is put in the wallet of the receiver.\n"},{"q":"Where are all the transactions stored","a":"Bitcoin works on a Blockchain ledger system (there is a separate deck for it). The transactions are stored in the ledger across all servers of the Bitcoin network.\n"},{"q":"Does this mean every transaction is on the ledger and know to one and all","a":"Yes. Except there is no way of linking a person to a particular bitcoin."},{"q":"How secure is it from someone else stealing money from your bitcoin wallet","a":"Almost impossible. Think of it like a password. If someone has your password, then they can transfer the bitcoin to others.    \n"},{"q":"How can I buy a Bitcoin","a":"1. In an exchange similar to how you buy shares. Someone sells you a bitcoin (or part of) based on current market prices.\n2. Or, by mining\n"},{"q":"What is mining","a":"The servers that constitute the bitcoin distributed network **work hard** to maintain the system. For that they are rewarded by bitcoins (or part of). They are called **miners**.\n"},{"q":"Can Bitcoin be infinitely generated or is it regulated in some form","a":"As per the original paper, it was decided to limit the total number of bitcoins to **21 million**.\n"},{"q":"Why is there a limit set for number of bitcoins","a":"This is to emulate the concept similar to that of physical gold viz there is a finite quantity to be mined.\n"},{"q":"And so far how many have been mined so far","a":"Around **19 million** bitcoins have been mined so far\n"},{"q":"How much more time will it take for the remainder 2 million to be mined","a":"By some estimates that will take place around 2040\n"},{"q":"Then, what happens after that","a":"No more bitcoins will be mined, of course. However, miners (folks running the servers) will continue to earn with transaction fee.\n"},{"q":"Can cryptocoins be pegged to an existing currency","a":"Yes, it can.
