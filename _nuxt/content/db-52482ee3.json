In some cases, you may just point to a place and you get *teleported* there\n"},{"q":"How would we use the keyboard to move","a":"For example:\n1. Moving the up and down arrow takes you forward or backward\n2. Similarly the left and right arrow moves you left or right\n3.

a VR headset require a mobile","a":"The simpler VR headsets require a mobile to utilise the capabilities of the mobile for **connectivity**, **mic**, **speaker** and **sensors**. \n&nbsp;\nHowever, standalone VR headsets are available which have all these capabilties in-built.\n"},{"q":"Which sensors are required for a VR experience","a":"Either from within the headset or via the smartphone, VRs use some combination of:\n- accelerometer \n- gyroscope \n- magnetometer\n- proximity sensor \n\nall to detect the user's motion in the virtual world.\n"},{"q":"What is an Accelerometer","a":"It is a tool that measures acceleration of the body as the user moves across the virtual world"},{"q":"What is a Gyroscope","a":"It is a tool to sense angular rotational velocity and acceleration of the body as the user turns"},{"q":"What is a Magnetometer","a":"It is a tool to detect the relative orientation of your mobile / VR relative to the Earth's magnetic north"},{"q":"Do we see other folks in the virtual world","a":"Yes. But as **avatars**.\n"},{"q":"What are avatars","a":"In VR terms, an avatar is a **3D graphical representation** of a user or the user's character or *persona*"},{"q":"Can we turn using VR","a":"Yes. It provides a 360 degree view of the virtual world. So turning and moving your head will change the view in all directions.\n"},{"q":"Can we move in the virtual world using VR headset","a":"Yes. When viewing through the headset there is a cursor (*much like the cursor of our computer*). Often, placing the cursor ahead and **tapping a button** on the side of the headset *transports* you there.\n"},{"q":"Can we speak to others in the virtual world","a":"It depends on how the virtual environment has been prepared; if they enable talking to others in the virtual room, then the **mic** and **speaker** (of the VR or mobile) will be used for communication"},{"q":"Who prepares a virtual world","a":"1. The Virtual world is prepared via a software running on some servers\n2. The Virtual elements like roads, building, walls, seats etc are needed to be created using computer graphics\n3. When we connect to that world (*like visiting a website*) one can move around and explore the world\n"},{"q":"Which companies make VR headsets","a":"Some of the popular names are:\n1. Oculus Rift\n2. Sony Playstation VR\n3. HTC Vive\n4.

All owned and controlled by the organisation who set up them up. In Web 3.0, the content will be **distributed on multiple servers** (as per the blockchain technology).\n"},{"q":"And what is the token-based economics mean","a":"That the creators of such a system could *offer their content* using crypto coins which users may have to furnish to *gain access* to information.\n"},{"q":"What is wrong with Web 2.0 that needed a change","a":"Some of the ills of the current internet usage are:\n1. Thanks to the popularity of social media, big-tech internet companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter have become powerful and have the ability to influence and control people.\n2. The privacy of most people using these networks is being compromised.\n3. These internet companies are leveraging the content created by news companies and individuals; thereby robbing them of their rightful revenue.\n"},{"q":"Who, then, would run the servers of any Web 3.0 website and why","a":"It is in the same manner in which the bitcoin and other blockchain networks work today. A set of *people/organisations* unconnected with one another. Except that they need *financial incentives* to be part of it. And that is provided by the token economics that we spoke about earlier,\n"},{"q":"Are there web 3.0 websites in existence today","a":"Tech folks are experimenting with it but none of the popular websites have moved to this proposed idea\n"},{"q":"Are there critics to Web 3.0","a":"There are many who believe that:\n- it is not going to be easy to implement a blockchain web\n- it still is going to be controlled by the few companies who are controlling the crypto world\n- that people in general are not ready for token economics for accessing content\n"},{"q":"What is the economics of current internet","a":"1. Corporations and / or Government set up the infrastructure required to run the internet servers\n2. They provide the service usually free or at minimal charges\n3. In return they capitalise the usage of their service by advertisements and/or influencing the users\n"},{"q":"How would the decentralised system protect privacy and ownership of content","a":"1. Blockchain distributed systems rely on encryption to prevent stealing of information\n2. This encryption also ensures no manipulation of someone else's data\n3. The distributed system ensures no unauthorised change to content\n4. With no single owner to the networks governments cannot access / request access to this information\n"},{"q":"Is Metaverse part of Web 3.0","a":"Folks are suggesting that the access to the Web 3.0 content should be via a Metaverse (*separate deck available*) interface\n"}],"dir":"/decks/en/what_is_web3","path":"/decks/en/what_is_web3/content","extension":".yaml","createdAt":"2022-02-07T05:13:44.900Z","updatedAt":"2022-02-09T05:44:56.506Z","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1646658664267},"$loki":44},{"slug":"content","id":"what_is_wordle","title":"What
