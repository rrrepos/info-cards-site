Bitcoin has no such governing body.\n"},{"q":"Does this mean no one owns Bitcoin","a":"Yes. Of sorts. There is no central bank, or banks who endorse a currency exchange between two parties like we have in conventional currency operations.\n"},{"q":"Who created Bitcoin","a":"A person by the name of **Satoshi Nakamoto**.

A desktop or notebook computer\n2. A Virtual Reality (VR) headset for an immersive experience\n3. Tactile Gloves will help feel objects in this  world\n4. Wrist sensors to feel sensation (e.g. *Bow & Arrow games*) \n5. Augmented Reality (AR) Glasses to interact with objects\n"},{"q":"Do I need to walk at home to move in the virtual world","a":"No! That would be disastrous. There are a number of ways this is accomplished\n1. Using the keyboard one can move in two directions\n2. People wear a harness around them and walk like in a treadmill\n3. In some cases, you may just point to a place and you get teleported there\n"},{"q":"How would we use the keyboard to move","a":"For example:\n1. Moving the up and down arrow takes you forward or backward\n2. Similarly the left and right arrow moves you left or right\n3. Perhaps, a shift + left will turn your view to the left\n\nWhile keyboard equivalents are available, having a VR headset makes the experience immersive. \n"},{"q":"How do we focus or point to an object","a":"Just like we have a cursor on a normal computer, so is the case with a Metaverse world. \n1. The cursor can be pointed to an object and clicked to select via a mouse.\n2. Or if one uses a headset, then we turn in the desired direction and position the cursor on that object and tap on a button on the side of the headset. \n"},{"q":"Can we move objects in Metaverse","a":"Yes, this is much like in the physical world, where using the hand gloves, you could touch objects, move them, lift them and place them elsewhere\n"},{"q":"Can we speak to others in Metaverse","a":"Yes. You would need a mic and a speaker to talk and listen to others, similar to how we use them in a video conferencing session.\n&nbsp;\nMany of the VR headsets have inbuilt speakers and mikes attached.\n"},{"q":"Then, how is it different from video conferencing","a":"It is 3D and the experience gives you a feeling of being in the other place\n"},{"q":"Can we see the other person like we do in a video","a":"No. Everyone is represented by an **avatar**. Though many create avatars which have a resemblance to their own self.\n"},{"q":"How are avatars created similar to oneself","a":"Avatar creation softwares are available that take a bunch of snaps from different positions or using a camera to create an avatar. These avatars have a fair resemblance to the person. Once made, it can be kept as an indentity for all worlds.\n"},{"q":"Would not people make avatars that are different from how they look","a":"Yes. And very often that is the case. In fact, one of the likely reasons for its popularity is that a person can be a very **different** one in this virtual world. \n"},{"q":"Why are people buying space in Metaverse worlds","a":"All real estate investments are for two purposes:\n1. To stay or enjoy the property\n2. As investment to sell it when it appreciates\n\n&nbsp;\nIn the case of Metaverse it is the latter.\n"},{"q":"Is this similar to the **Real Player One** movie","a":"Yes.
