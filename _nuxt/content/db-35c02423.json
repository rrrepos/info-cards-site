Thus, an accounting ledger is a list of accounting transactions ordered by date or by account or by both. Similarly, a stock ledger is a list of incoming and outgoing items from a store; again ordered by item or by date."},{"q":"So what is a **Blocked Ledger**","a":"A Block Ledger is a group of transactions. This grouping could be all transactions by date or just a number of transactions."},{"q":"What, then, is a **Blockchain Ledger**","a":"A Blockchain Ledger is one when the Blocks of a ledger are chained together in terms of T1 (transaction 1) to T5 in, say, block B1. And you have transactions T6 to, say, T12 in block B2. And we also chain Block B2 to the end of B1. Then these become a BlockChain Ledger."},{"q":"Isn't this how all most digital ledgers work","a":"No. Because the trasactions in a Blockchain ledger system is not kept at one central place, but decentralised and distributed across different computers in a network."},{"q":"What does **Decentralised** Ledger mean","a":"If a ledger is not controlled by a central computer it is called a Decentralised Ledger"},{"q":"What does **Distributed** Ledger mean","a":"If a ledger, like a Blockchain Ledger, is available on multiple servers it is a Distributed Ledger"},{"q":"What is a **node**","a":"Another name for servers (computers) in a network"},{"q":"Are multiple copies of the data stored on multiple servers of the Blockchain network","a":"Yes."},{"q":"Is it not a waste of resources","a":"No. Since this is the only way to prevent a single ownership of data"},{"q":"What is wrong with someone storing all the data","a":"This gives that party leverage to control the use of that data. Examples of centralised data are:\n\n1. Government institutions like the Central Bank or Finance Ministry etc\n2. Social networks like: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc\n3. Digital Marketplaces like Amazon etc\n"},{"q":"So who owns the data in a Blockchain ledger system","a":"Collectively, by all the nodes of that distributed system"},{"q":"Then, would not the node control the data similar to how a central server has control of the data","a":"No.\n\nBecause the underlying principles of the blockchain network software ensures that no single node can unilaterally change the ledger data. There needs to be a consensus between all the nodes\n"},{"q":"Consensus? Meaning what?","a":"If any node makes a change to the ledger viz. adds, removes or updates an entry then other nodes will need to validate that change before the ledger gets updated"},{"q":"And how is that done?","a":"All via the underlying blockchain ledger software"},{"q":"Why is blockchain getting the sort of attention it does","a":"Because it removes the existence of a third-party to validate a transaction between two individuals"},{"q":"What are examples of third-party intermediaries that exist in the world today","a":"1.
